Earlier this week the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean—seriously, that’s the name—<a title=Bluefin href=#>released the latest assessment</a>&nbsp;(PDF) of the Pacific bluefin tuna population. The bluefin tuna is the <a title="Study Shows that Bluefin Tuna Is Being Severely Overfished" href=#>tiger of the sea</a>—in more ways than one. It’s a top of the food chain predator that can grow to over 1,000 lbs. and swim at speeds above 50 mph. In captivity—you can see them at the great <a title=Monterey href=#>Monterey Bay Aquarium</a> in northern <a href=#>California</a>—they shimmer like sports cars. Unfortunately for the tuna, they also happen to be delicious—the flesh of the bluefin tuna is prized by sushi chefs in the high-end restaurants of <a href=#>Japan</a>. Just last week, a 489-lb. bluefin <a title=Bluefin href=#>was sold at a fish auction</a> in Tokyo for a record $1.76 million—or about $3,600 per pound.</p><p>So it’s not surprising that the Pacific bluefin tuna—as well as its cousins in the Atlantic—are the subject of single-minded hunts by fishermen wherever they are found. But it’s always been difficult to determine just how rapidly the bluefin is being fished out—in part, possibly, because countries like Japan that do most of the fishing and most of the consumption of bluefin don’t really want those numbers made public. It’s a strategy that <a title=Gas href=#>should be familiar</a> from a lot of environmental policy battles.</p><p>But back to that scientific report. Buried deep in the highly technical language of the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Stock Assessment is a number: 0.036. That’s the depletion ratio for one of the computer simulation runs done that tries to model the effect of fishing on the bluefin tuna population. By itself, 0.036 doesn’t seem to mean&nbsp;much—unless you do some more math. In the simulations, the number 1 represents the estimated population of the bluefin tuna before we started fishing. 0.036 is what’s left now. Convert that to a percentage, and you get 96.4%. Which means that by the best guesses of scientists, the Pacific bluefin tuna population <a title=Pew href=#>has declined by 96.4%</a> since we began fishing it decades ago. 96.4%. No wonder that bluefin sold in Tokyo was so valuable. There may not be many fish left in the sea.</p><p>I should point out that I didn’t actually do the math on this one myself. That’s well beyond my English degree. Instead I called up Amanda Nickson, who directs global tuna conservation at the Pew Environment Group, who helped me put the numbers in perspective. She pointed out the even the most optimistic model in the report estimated that the bluefin population had fallen by 94%, and the most pessimistic put the figure at 97.9%. Even worse, as Nickson told me, “at least 90% of the fish being caught have not yet reached reproductive age, which obviously undermines their ability to reproduce.” So not only are we <a title="A Must-Read Book on the Future of Fish" href=#>decimating the population of the bluefin</a>, but we’re not even giving them the chance to rebuild their numbers.</p><p>Pew’s recommendation, echoed by many other environmental groups and scientists, is that the Pacific bluefin tuna fishery should be suspended, at least until there’s more effective management that might prevent overfishing. “There are no sustainable catch limits,” says Nickson. “The countries involved have been doing this for decades despite the science telling them that they shouldn’t.” There has been some progress in recent years. While there is virtually no management in the fisheries of the western Pacific, last June <a title=Pacific href=#>there were limits</a> adopted for the first time for bluefin tuna fishing in the eastern Pacific. Those conservation measures actually caused the fishery to close early in August when the limits were exceeded. It’s a start, at the very least—and it should also include a pledge by diners to <a title=Time href=#>eschew bluefin tuna</a> just as they would any other endangered species. But if we don’t do much more, one of the most majestic fish in the sea may disappear for good.</p><p><strong>(MORE: <a title=Bluefin href=#>Saving Bluefin Tuna: Don’t Eat It</a>)</strong><br><i><br></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk56yr6%2FEZ6uipZVjsLC5jmtnamtfZX5wfZBoq6GdXaWupLXFoppmmpyqsqe1zWarrqaRYra0ecClpKirpGK0sLrEaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./20-examples-of-parents-love-that-can-take-very-different-shapes-796874.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>20+ Examples of Parents Love That Can Take Very Different Shapes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./he-inherited-none-of-his-fathers-charm-fans-divided-after-finally-seeing-richard-geres-son-819195.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Quite Lacking in the Attractiveness Department, Fans Divided After Finally Seeing Richard Gere</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

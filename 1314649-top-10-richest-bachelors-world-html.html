Jan Koum (44 years) - $9.9 billion</h3><p class=align-left>You probably have heard about <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jan Koum</a> if you are a dedicated social network user. The eligible billionaire is the man who co-founded WhatsApp (alongside Brian Acton).</p><p class=align-left>In 2014, the two inventors sold the messaging application to Facebook at about $22 billion. That explains Jan's current net worth of $9.7 billion.</p><p class=align-left>But even after selling WhatsApp, Jan retained his CEO position until 2018. He also left the Facebook board the same year.</p><p class=align-left>Jan Koum was born in 1976 in Kyiv, Ukraine, but currently resides in California, USA. Though he is a billionaire now, Koum had a humble origin.</p><p class=align-left>He was born to a poor Jewish family in Kyiv. His family's problems were compounded with political strife in Ukraine.</p><p class=align-left>The conditions were unfavorable for the family, and this compelled them to move to the United States. Jan would then work as a grocery attendant while his mother would babysit to make ends meet.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4urfo2g3994.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>5 most handsome billionaires in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Jan took advantage of the little money he made to pursue education. He enrolled at San Jose University and would work part-time at Ernst & Young. He met Brian Acton at Ernest & Young, and the two collaborated to co-found WhatsApp.</p><p class=align-left>But before the creation, the two first worked at Yahoo after leaving Ernest & Young. The pressure at Yahoo was, unfortunately, too much, and this forced Koum to quit university. So, he never got the chance to graduate.</p><p class=align-left>But before Jan co-created WhatsApp, he had served Yahoo for almost nine years. Interestingly, Koum had given $1.15 billion of his Facebook stock to charity just before leaving the social network. So, he is not only rich and single but also a man with a philanthropic personality.</p><p class=align-left>The two co-founded WhatsApp in 2009 after spending nine years in Yahoo, and WhatsApp Messenger a year later. In 2014, Facebook came calling, and they tabled an offer that Jan and Brian could not turn down.</p><h3>1. Mikhail Prokhorov (54 years) - $11.3 billion</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ca8a2072dfcfaba.png><p class=align-left>Now you have the answer to who is the richest bachelor in the world? Until 2018, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mikhail Prokhorov </a>was the proud owner of the Brooklyn Nets. Now, the NBA club belongs to Joseph Tsai of Alibaba, who paid $2.3 billion for Mikhail's 49% stake.</p><p class=align-left>Mikhail Prokhorov was born in Moscow, Russia, in 1965. He is currently one of the most eligible bachelors over 50 years old. He went to Moscow Finance Institute, after which he landed his first job at the International Bank for Economic Corporation.</p><p class=align-left>He served as a manager at the corporation for a few years before joining MFK Bank and the United Export-Import Bank.</p><p class=align-left>Business-wise, Mikhail first partnered with Potanin, and the two founded Interros, a Russian holding firm. They used the company to buy Norilsk Nickel, a giant mining corporation.</p><p class=align-left>Mikhail founded Onexim Group after exiting Interros. The private investment funded the purchase of Renaissance Capital and IFC Bank.</p><p class=align-left>He bought the New Jersey Nets in 2010 for $223 million and opted to change its name to the Brooklyn Nets.</p><p class=align-left>In politics, Mikhail ran for the Russian presidency in 2012 but only garnered 8% of the vote cast. He currently has stakes in CSKA Basketball Club, a professional Euroleague basketball team.</p><p class=align-left>Mikhail globally known to be a ladies' man but is far from settling down. He flies in private jets and hangs around hot ladies. He practices biathlon and professional boxing.</p><p class=align-left>In 2007, Mikhail grabbed the headlines for the wrong reason in the U.S when he was charged with importing prostitutes from Russia. The scandal was so ugly that it forced him to sell his stake at Norilsk Nickel. He got about $7.5 billion from the sale.</p><p class=align-left>At one point, Mikhail lost about $55 million, a deposit amount needed to bid for the Villa Leopold. Following an appraisal amount of about $750 million for the 20-acre estate (believed to have been built by King Leopold II), Mikhail walked away. It meant that he had to forfeit the $55 million he deposited as it was nonrefundable.</p><p class=align-left>Still, the notorious Russian billionaire can afford to throw money around. He comes to mind when you ask: who is the richest single man in the world?</p><p class=align-left>There are exciting prospects when it comes to the richest bachelors in the world.

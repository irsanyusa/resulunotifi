Peanut butter and jelly. <a href=# rel=noopener>Frog and Toad.</a> The eponymous dynamic duo, created by children’s book author and illustrator <a href=#>Arnold Lobel</a>, first hopped onto pages in 1970 with <i>Frog and Toad Are Friends</i>, earning a Caldecott Honor, a top illustration award. Over the next decade, Lobel wrote and illustrated three more collections of five short stories, equal parts poignant and droll: <i>Frog and Toad Together</i> (a Newbery Honor Book), <i>Frog and Toad All Year</i>, and <i>Days With Frog and Toad</i>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now, the beloved pair is entering a new era with <i>Frog and Toad</i>, an animated series of eight episodes, each containing two stories, debuting April 28 on <a href=#>Apple TV+</a>. Of the 16 short stories on screen, six are new additions, and the rest were adapted from the books.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The series is executive produced by Lobel’s children, Adrianne and Adam Lobel, who hope the show will reintroduce new audiences to their father’s work, which includes many other books, like the <i>Mister Muster</i> series, <i>Prince Bertram the Bad</i>, <i>Giant John</i>, <i>Owl at Home</i>, and <i>Fables</i>. For the generations that grew up on them, <a href=#><i>Frog and Toad</i></a><a href=#> are classics</a> steeped in nostalgia. But children watching the show now might be discovering the amphibians for the first time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When he was towards the end of his life, when he didn’t have much more time, he’d say to me, ‘Look for me in the books. I’m in there,’” Adam tells TIME. “I told my daughter that. I said, ‘Yeah, this is him. Read these stories, you’ll know him about as well as I did.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frog-and-Toad-Ice-Cream-2.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>No matter the format, Frog and Toad are forever</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s hard to put a webbed finger on what, exactly, makes <i>Frog and Toad</i> so timeless. The main characters and their adventures are delightful to be sure, but it’s the dynamic between Frog and Toad that stands out. Frog is chipper and easygoing, whereas Toad is more serious and pessimistic (though just as caring). Writer Bert Clere <a href=# rel=noopener>postulated</a> for <i>The Atlantic</i> that they represent two sides of the same identity: “Frog represents the practical and sensible part of the self, while Toad is emotional and tempestuous.” Lobel even <a href=# rel=noopener>claimed them</a> as “really two aspects of myself.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Their relationship is so funny,” Adrianne says. “It reminds everybody of their own marriages and friendships. They’re <a href=# rel=noopener><i>The Odd Couple</i></a>. They’re Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And the stories involving Frog, Toad, and the woodland creatures they encounter satisfy on several levels. Take, for example, “Ice Cream,” a delicious tale from <i>Frog and Toad All Year</i>. In the book, Frog and Toad are sitting by a pond on a hot summer day. “I wish we had some sweet, cold ice cream,” says Frog. And off Toad goes to the ice cream store, where he buys two chocolate ice cream cones (their favorite), and tries his best to bring them back. Except it’s too hot: The ice cream melts all over Toad, and the cones stick to the top of his head, creating the illusion of horns.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A mouse, a squirrel, and a rabbit all briefly warn Frog about the big, brown monster headed his way. “Good heavens!” says Frog. “That thing is Toad!” Toad falls into the pond and the ice cream washes away, but all’s well that ends well: The friends run back to the store, buy two new cones, and eat them contentedly in the shade. It’s a sweet metaphor, perhaps, about tenacity—but also, as Lobel always made <i>Frog and Toad</i>, about the value of friendship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That was what his brilliance was,” Adrianne says, “in making these tiny stories so absolutely complete.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The TV show brings “Ice Cream” alive while preserving the whimsical heart and tone of the story. The pond is beautifully illustrated, replete with purple-flowered lily pads. We meet Mouse, sipping water from a clover, Squirrel, enjoying a cone of his own, and Mink, the ice cream shop proprietor. In the book, we catch a glimpse of a thumbnail-sized ice cream shop, just the edge of an awning. On screen, the shop fits neatly into the aesthetic, built into the base of a tree trunk, mushrooms climbing its walls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Frog-and-Toad-Ice-Cream.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inside, as Toad (Kevin Michael Richardson) struggles to choose a flavor, Mink (Tom Kenny), sporting a retro diner hat, breaks into song. “We’ve got raspberry, strawberry, huckleberry, ground-cherry, peanut butter, coconut, rocky road and Fluffernutter, bubblegum, wild plum,” he sings. “Try the peach, I’ll give you some! Triple ripple choco-cicle, pumpkin spice and lemon slice, custard cream, mangosteen, jelly bean! And vanilla.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s an earworm song—one that’s easy to imagine kids requesting again and again.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>How </b><b><i>Frog and Toad</i></b><b> made it to TV</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before landing on the show, the siblings had considered making <i>Frog and Toad</i> into a feature film. Adrianne previously commissioned a <a href=# rel=noopener>Broadway musical</a> about the characters, called <i>A Year with Frog and Toad</i>. But they worried about their father’s involvement being forgotten and Frog and Toad meeting a similar fate as Shrek—the popularity of <a href=#>the movie </a><i>Shrek</i> has largely eclipsed the children’s book it’s based on, <i>Shrek!</i> by William Steig. To the siblings, the smaller format of TV feels more true to the books; each short story is already a self-contained episode.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They’re little stories,” says Adam. “They’re not big, swashbuckling adventures. They may be universal concepts, but they’re little.” (Some may argue that one original story in episode 3, “Dragons and Giants,” <i>is</i>, in fact, a swashbuckling adventure, but the point still holds.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Adam says he is frankly amazed that the creative team—including head writer and executive producer Rob Hoegee—managed to craft 11 minutes of animation out of each roughly 12-page story. Their father loved animation—he dragged Adrianne to see <i>Bambi</i> when she was 2 (too young) and Adam to see <i>Pinocchio</i> when he was 14 (too old)—and Adam thinks he would have been happy to see his creatures in moving form.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Arnold-Lobel-1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Arnold Lobel was quite a private person, but four years after the first <i>Frog and Toad</i> book was published, he came out to his family as gay. In 2016, Adrianne <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> the <i>New Yorker</i> that Frog and Toad are “of the same sex, and they love each other. It was quite ahead of its time in that respect. I think <i>Frog and Toad</i> really was the beginning of him coming out.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I know Frog and Toad started as a male and female, way, way, way back in the beginning,” Adrianne says. “And I think it’s good they’re not. I think they’re better off as two guys, as being friends.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was very different times,” says Adam. “Who knows what would be going on if it were today?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Frog and Toad have a Bert and Ernie dynamic: a close, emotionally intimate relationship. And Arnold Lobel, for his part, loved vaudeville comedy duos, says Adrianne: Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, Laurel and Hardy, or the dynamic between Fred Astaire and his comedic foil Edward Everett Horton. No matter what, exactly, Frog and Toad are to each other, to the world they remain a cherished portrait of lifelong friendship.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamdqf3qAjp%2BpqJ9dlruledOomJ1lkaW9rbGMra1mmZSWvbWt06Kmp2c%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ansel-elgort-denies-sexual-assault-teenage-girl-1234642752.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ansel Elgort Denies Accusation of Sexually Assaulting a Teenage Girl</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-mushrooms-grow-in-circles-and-14-phenomena-that-defy-all-logic-815389.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why Mushrooms Grow in Circles and 14 Phenomena That Defy All Logic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

While it’s an&nbsp;absolutely normal request, many men are happy to&nbsp;help out in&nbsp;this way. The same was for our today’s <a href=# title=hero data-link=tag>hero</a>, a&nbsp;married man, 30, who just wanted to&nbsp;help his wife. But when he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the store, he&nbsp;unexpectedly got involved into a&nbsp;huge and unpleasant <a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a>, and he&nbsp;wrote to&nbsp;us about it&nbsp;to&nbsp;find out what we&nbsp;and our readers think about the whole situation.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;man wrote an&nbsp;emotional letter to&nbsp;our editorial.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ff/079/e616e554bba5cd9ae769363a89.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man, 30, has recently sent a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial where he&nbsp;told&nbsp;us about an&nbsp;incident that left a&nbsp;very bitter aftertaste for him. He&nbsp;started his <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a>, saying that he’s married and his wife, 28, has very painful periods. He&nbsp;wrote that on&nbsp;these days she cannot literally leave the house, because she has very huge menstrual cramps, severe migraines and <a href=# title=nausea data-link=tag>nausea</a> on&nbsp;these days.</p><p>So, sometimes, when she feels totally sick because of&nbsp;her periods, she asks her husband to&nbsp;buy her menstrual pads or&nbsp;tampons. The man revealed that he&nbsp;used to&nbsp;feel uncomfortable about these requests in&nbsp;the past, and explained the reason why.</p><p>He&nbsp;wrote, “When Jenny, my&nbsp;wife, asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;pick her up&nbsp;some pads or&nbsp;tampons, I&nbsp;would feel shy about doing&nbsp;so. I&nbsp;was raised in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very conservative family, where my&nbsp;mom never spoke about periods to&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad or&nbsp;to&nbsp;me. And she used to&nbsp;buy these hygienic things for herself in&nbsp;stashes, always making sure she has some left enough for her next period. I&nbsp;have never heard her asking dad to&nbsp;pick some tampons for her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;local store, so&nbsp;for&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;totally new and uncomfortable experience when my&nbsp;wife asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;for the first time.”</p><p><h2>Soon it&nbsp;has become not a&nbsp;problem anymore for the man to&nbsp;buy his wife tampons.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84c/185/5899fe5a8397a74632ab1b5588.jpg><p>The man continues his story, saying, that his wife has always been very understanding and rarely asked him to&nbsp;buy these intimate toiletries for her. But once, when she went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=supermarket data-link=tag>supermarket</a> on&nbsp;her first day of&nbsp;periods to&nbsp;buy pads, she fainted because of&nbsp;the pain in&nbsp;her stomach.</p><p>The man wrote that after that case they had a&nbsp;talk, and he&nbsp;suggested that she should ask him to&nbsp;buy pads and tampons from then&nbsp;on. This topic was normalized in&nbsp;their family, and soon it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;normal thing for him to&nbsp;buy her the pads. He&nbsp;only had some issues left with buying her tampons, because she only recently switched to&nbsp;them, and he&nbsp;needed some explanation from his wife, together with a&nbsp;photo, about what sort of&nbsp;tampons needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;bought.</p><p><h2>One day, the unsuspecting man was again helping his wife out with this intimate thing.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f76/ea2/1f8a1c5312a72228fb202159ba.jpg><p>The man continues his story, saying, “Last Monday, my&nbsp;wife texted me&nbsp;as&nbsp;usual and asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop by&nbsp;a&nbsp;supermarket after work and pick her up&nbsp;some tampons. She then sent me&nbsp;a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the package that she needed. I’m a&nbsp;man, and&nbsp;I never used one, so&nbsp;I would still be&nbsp;confused without that additional information.”</p><p>Things went totally wrong when he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the store. He&nbsp;detailed the incident, saying, "So&nbsp;I&nbsp;was standing in&nbsp;the aisle looking at&nbsp;all the female products. I&nbsp;was still confused and lost, despite having an&nbsp;exact photo of&nbsp;what&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;buy, because&nbsp;I didn’t see such a&nbsp;box on&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the shelves. Then I&nbsp;heard a&nbsp;lady say, “Well, no&nbsp;matter how you dress, you’re still born a&nbsp;woman.”</p><p>The man was confused and looked up&nbsp;to&nbsp;see who was talking to&nbsp;whom. He&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;lady in&nbsp;her 40s just standing there and glaring at&nbsp;him. He&nbsp;responded, saying, “I’m sorry, are you talking to&nbsp;me?” as&nbsp;there was only her and him in&nbsp;the isle.</p><p>The woman then rolled her eyes and started a&nbsp;rant about the transgender topic, and she was being very unfriendly to&nbsp;anyone who is&nbsp;transgender. After she finished her speech, the man was absolutely shocked by&nbsp;such attitude. He&nbsp;wrote, “I&nbsp;just started laughing to&nbsp;show her that her words cannot be&nbsp;taken seriously by&nbsp;anyone. Her face turned very red. She started screaming, but&nbsp;I just cut her off.”</p><p>The man tried to&nbsp;calm her down, saying, “Listen lady, if&nbsp;I was born a&nbsp;woman, would I&nbsp;be looking so&nbsp;clueless and lost as&nbsp;I&nbsp;am right now? Is&nbsp;this the first time when you see a&nbsp;man buying tampons for a&nbsp;woman?”</p><p><h2>The man handled the scandal masterfully.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f96/0ca/8736c4537e98a87627705bc67b.jpg><p>The man goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying that he&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lady that a&nbsp;man buying pads and tampons for his wife is&nbsp;just called a&nbsp;good husband. His wife wanted tampons, and he&nbsp;did her a&nbsp;favor. He&nbsp;then held up&nbsp;his phone and pointed at&nbsp;the pick, asking her, “Now do&nbsp;you see this brand on&nbsp;the shelf?”</p><p>The woman still didn’t even apologize for being so&nbsp;rude to&nbsp;the man and transgender people in&nbsp;particular. She just backed away, with her eyes big, and her face drained, and walked pretty quickly down the aisle.</p><p>The man wrote, “I&nbsp;then finally found the needed box, checked out and made my&nbsp;beloved wife happy.”</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;think that the way the man acted was totally normal.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a92/b4c/c87a255a8baaf33e7cbff42653.jpg><p>We’re grateful to&nbsp;the man for his trust in&nbsp;our editorial and for sharing this story with&nbsp;us.</p><p>We&nbsp;think that, first and foremost, the lady was totally rude to&nbsp;ever comment on&nbsp;someone’s purchasing anything. She interfered with a&nbsp;private matter of&nbsp;another person, and of&nbsp;course her comments were just out-of-place.</p><p>It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;ideal if&nbsp;the lady suggested the man to&nbsp;help him out with finding the right package, instead of&nbsp;shouting at&nbsp;him and making vile comments about the man and transgender people.</p><p>We&nbsp;think the man acted right. He&nbsp;wasn’t rude to&nbsp;the lady in&nbsp;return, and he&nbsp;explained to&nbsp;her everything in&nbsp;a&nbsp;calm and moderate manner. He&nbsp;didn’t make the scandal even bigger by&nbsp;adding his own anger about the situation.</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, for whom a&nbsp;<a href=#>tampon</a> found in&nbsp;her husband’s car opened up&nbsp;a&nbsp;real Pandora’s box of&nbsp;bad revelations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuw8Snq2asn2KvtsWMprBmr5mbsm7AwKanqKajYq6vsIygpq1lmaPBsHnAZp%2Bun5ViwKStzZ2YpWWZo3qiedKup56qnZa%2FrLHTZm9qb2ZpgHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fabriques-de-territoires-les-29-laureats-de-lami-sajoutent-aux-189-deja-labellises.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>les 29 laurats de l'AMI s'ajoutent aux 189 dj labelliss</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./good-grief-review-daniel-levy-1235850491.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Good Grief Review: Daniel Levys Cathartic Feature Debut Imagines a Different Kind of</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

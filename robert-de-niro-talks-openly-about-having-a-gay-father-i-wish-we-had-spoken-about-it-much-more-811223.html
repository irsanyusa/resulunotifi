But recently, he&nbsp;also opened up&nbsp;about a&nbsp;personal aspect of&nbsp;his life that he’s kept private for decades&nbsp;— his relationship with his father, Robert De&nbsp;Niro Sr. The elder <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>De&nbsp;Niro</a> was a&nbsp;renowned <a href=# title=artist data-link=tag>artist</a> who kept his homosexuality hidden throughout his life.</p><p><h2>Robert De&nbsp;Niro&nbsp;Sr. felt guilty about being gay.</h2></p><p>Robert De&nbsp;Niro&nbsp;Sr. was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>renowned</a> artist and art dealer who had a&nbsp;career that spanned several decades. He&nbsp;was known for his bold use of&nbsp;color in&nbsp;his paintings, which often incorporated elements of&nbsp;abstraction and expressionism. Despite his success in&nbsp;art, he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;reconcile his artistic passions with his personal life, particularly his sexuality. He&nbsp;was gay, something that wasn’t discussed openly during his lifetime and that he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;keep hidden for most of&nbsp;his life.</p><p>In&nbsp;his book <i>Things I&nbsp;Wish I’d Known: Reflections on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Life</i>, Robert De&nbsp;Niro&nbsp;Sr. wrote about the guilt he&nbsp;felt about his sexuality, which added to&nbsp;the complexity of&nbsp;his life. He&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;terms with his feelings and wrote in&nbsp;his journal about his feelings of&nbsp;<a href=# title=fear data-link=tag>fear</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discomfort</a>, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his desire for acceptance.</p><p><h2>Robert De&nbsp;Niro wasn’t aware of&nbsp;his father’s struggles.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c7f/ad3/0138305e639f0e70055d809f3c.jpg><p>EAST NEWS<span>, </span>EAST NEWS</p><p>Robert had a&nbsp;complex relationship with his father. He&nbsp;separated from his wife, Robert De&nbsp;Niro Jr.’s mother, when the actor was just 2&nbsp;years old, but the couple didn’t officially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorce</a> until a&nbsp;decade later when De&nbsp;Niro&nbsp;Jr. was 12. Despite their separation, he&nbsp;considered his father a&nbsp;good dad and described him as&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving and devoted father who was always present in&nbsp;his life.</p><p>However, growing&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realize</a> his father’s torment over his sexuality. It&nbsp;was only later in&nbsp;life, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young adult, that his mother opened up&nbsp;to&nbsp;him about&nbsp;it, albeit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;vague and ambiguous manner. The revelation confused him, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;was not an&nbsp;openly discussed topic in&nbsp;his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p>The lack of&nbsp;open <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> and understanding weighed heavily on&nbsp;him, and he&nbsp;recently opened up&nbsp;in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, “I&nbsp;wish we&nbsp;had spoken about it&nbsp;much more,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “My&nbsp;mother didn’t want to&nbsp;talk about things in&nbsp;general, and you’re not interested when you’re a&nbsp;certain age.”</p><p><h2>Robert De&nbsp;Niro&nbsp;Sr. passed away in&nbsp;1993, leaving a&nbsp;precious legacy in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;4&nbsp;journals filled with his reflections and inner thoughts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0d6/296/08dedf5343a8e989c86ef0cde5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his journals, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “I&nbsp;am full of&nbsp;fear... of&nbsp;the discomfort caused by&nbsp;my&nbsp;own thoughts, feelings, sensations. There is&nbsp;so&nbsp;much&nbsp;I have left out of&nbsp;this journal... My&nbsp;laments, wailings, self-pity, and complaining are much greater than&nbsp;I have [indicated] here.”</p><p>De&nbsp;Niro delves into his father’s personal musings by&nbsp;reading parts from De&nbsp;Niro Sr.’s journals. They provide an&nbsp;in-depth look into his father’s internal struggles, particularly regarding accepting his sexuality.</p><p>Through reading these journals, De&nbsp;Niro has gained a&nbsp;deeper understanding of&nbsp;his father and the challenges he&nbsp;faced. He&nbsp;reflects on&nbsp;this, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “Obviously, I&nbsp;realize now that it&nbsp;was hard for him.

He&nbsp;also produced an&nbsp;HBO documentary in&nbsp;tribute to&nbsp;his father’s life and work.</p><p>Robert De&nbsp;Niro’s story is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reminder that even the most successful and accomplished individuals have their demons to&nbsp;battle.

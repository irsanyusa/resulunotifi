Millennials, who make up the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>largest share of Gen Alpha children</a> and are the most likely to be using parental leave, show the strongest support.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Our research shows there is also <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>broad support by political party</a>, as well.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Most workers view a company’s parental leave policies as important, but they fall to the bottom of their workplace “must haves”</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While a majority (61%) of U.S. adults say parental leave is at least “somewhat” important when considering a potential employer, the benefit is dwarfed by other employment factors including health insurance and paid time off. To some extent, this is to be expected — but it’s noteworthy that a majority of workers still cite parental leave so high.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Key groups are likely to place more importance on a&nbsp; potential employer’s leave policies including women (62%), millennials (70%) and active job seekers (67%), or those who have been looking for a new position in the past four weeks.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Brands with consumer bases like Kyte Baby have the most to lose — and gain — from purpose driven marketing</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As we enter what is sure to be another explosive election year, brands need to arm themselves with an understanding of their consumer base — and how that base will react to PR missteps. (More importantly, perhaps, is that they ensure their public image matches the decisions they're making every day, no matter how small. Consumers are always watching.)</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Kyte Baby’s high-end organic clothing product offering makes its consumer base a bit more wealthy, for example. It also leans millennial and parental. Morning Consult research shows that these demographics are more likely to boycott a brand compared to the average consumer, validating the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>calls to boycott</a> Kyte Baby.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Twenty-two percent of U.S. adults said they have boycotted a brand in the past year over political reasons, according to Morning Consult’s 2024 <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>corporate activism playbook</a>, a figure that grows among millennial parents, wealthier millennials and wealthy millennials who use social media at least daily.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">This specific consumer base will also go out of their way to purchase goods and services from brands that match their values. Millennials, especially wealthy millennials who are daily social media users, are more likely than the average American to say they’ve buycotted a brand, or spent money to support a company over the past year for political reasons.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A brand crisis like this becomes even more risky during an election year, when politicians are eager to use&nbsp; news cycle fodder to pitch voters on, and curry favor for, their own policy agenda. That’s even more true for issues such as parental leave, which have such broad bipartisan support. And the consumers who take their cues from politicians tend to also be those who express their values with their pocketbook.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Kyte Baby has put itself at risk of becoming a political punching bag this year. But if it can avoid that level of scrutiny, and carry out meaningful changes to its leave policies that customers want to see, it’s likely that just like many other brand scandals, consumers’ short memories will mean the company can put this incident behind them.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6WuqrCMn5imoZyueq2xwK%2BcZqOpqbJursCbsGaaopa7pb8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

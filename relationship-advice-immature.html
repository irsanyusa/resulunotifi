Mark’s message to me went like this: “The girl I love tells me all the time that I’m immature and need to grow up. How can I make myself more mature?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Upon reading this message initially, I chuckled. Something about the idea of just making yourself more mature sounded silly to me. My next reaction, however, was to sigh with sadness. Mark’s predicament hit at my heart and got me wondering about the role of “maturity” in relationships.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I wondered: Is Mark’s partner insulting him meaninglessly by calling him “immature”? Or is she voicing a legitimate concern about his readiness to be a good partner?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course, we don’t know her specific concerns with Mark’s behavior. But if you’ve ever been on the receiving end of the “immature” label, you may be curious what it means for you as well. Let’s break down what “immature” may mean for you and your relationship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Cause and Effect</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When someone calls their partner “immature,” it’s often because Partner A appears to not understand something that’s completely obvious to Partner B.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For example, “immature” might be the adjective of choice to describe someone who seems unaware that if you don’t keep track of your money, you run out of money. Or it could describe someone who appears to not understand that if you stay out all night, you will perform badly at your big meeting the next day. In other words, they appear to not “get” cause and effect.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This application of the “immature” label requires a deeper understanding of what’s really causing the seemingly illogical behavior. One option is that, if you’re young and have less life experience, you may have never felt the negative consequences of risky behavior before.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You may have never lost a job, squandered an opportunity, or run out of money before—and therefore don’t feel the fear of consequences in the same way a more experienced person might. This is a pitfall of youth (or a blessing of youth, depending on how you look at it) and can’t fairly be assigned as a character flaw in the other person. It’s just being young.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alternatively, Partner A may fully understand cause and effect—she may have felt her fair share of consequences—she may simply not value the same things that Partner B does. She may know that staying up late effects work performance… she just values fun and spontaneity more than achievement at work. This is not a character flaw either; it’s simply a difference in values.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Emotional Maturity</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another common behavior often deemed “immature” is the inability to deal with emotions—either one’s own emotions or someone else’s. Like understanding cause and effect, this can be a product of youth—18-year-olds are understandably less equipped to deal with strong emotions than say, 40-year-olds—but it can also be something that a person struggles with their whole life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An inability to manage emotions, while not a character flaw per se, can indeed hurt one’s ability to be a good partner. If this is the type of “immaturity” you see in your own relationship, it’s likely a fair thing to point out to your partner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Personal Responsibility</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another common expression of “immaturity” is a refusal to take responsibility for one’s own actions or choices. This would include a partner who blames his own failings on other people, refuses to admit fault, or behaves as if he’s a victim in circumstances where he’s clearly not.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like emotional maturity, the tendency to deflect personal responsibility is a real problem for relationships. It’s extremely hard to have a fair and equal dynamic when one person can’t take ownership for his part in the relationship. This is, in my opinion, a fair and valid complaint to have with one’s partner.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>…But is the “Immature” Label Fair?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As you can see, there’s not just one cause of “immaturity.” There are probably many more related behaviors than the ones I’ve listed here. To me, this points toward the real problem with calling someone “immature” or insisting that they “need to grow up.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>“Immature” isn’t a helpful word in relationships because it’s too vague to know how to work on it. It’s a catch-all term that can mean any number of things. For this reason, it’s not actionable and therefore not useful.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This very problem is echoed in the email that sparked this whole discussion. Mark wants to improve himself and please his partner, but he doesn’t know how to “un-immature” himself. He doesn’t know what that would look like. That’s because the term itself is too vague. And it’s only possible to improve yourself if you know precisely what you’re aiming to improve.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s time to eliminate “immature” from our relationship vocabulary. If you find yourself wanting to use the term, ask yourself how else you could describe your qualms with your partner. This will help you more accurately describe what’s bothering you and increase your partner’s chances of being able to fix it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtamRof3aBjqucpZmknryvv8eip2aZlKu2pLGMoqSmmaSqv6Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./czech-christmas-traditions.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Czech Christmas Traditions - Live &amp;amp; Study</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./plateau-state-news-today.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Plateau State News Online | Daily Updates</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

Some party members have <a href=#>called for him to remain in post</a>, while elsewhere a <a href=#>role in NATO</a> is seemingly on the cards, and some say he should <a href=#>be appointed to the next cabinet</a>.</p><p>No matter who the next tenant of Number 10 is, the first job will be building a new team of cabinet members – but who do Conservatives want to see at the top table?</p><p>Kemi Badenoch, who made it to the final four of the leadership race, is the most popular choice for a cabinet position, with 84% of Conservative members wanting a role for her. A mere 8% think she should not be appointed to a ministerial role. Badenoch is also the most popular choice for a cabinet role among both supporters of Rishi Sunak (81%) and Liz Truss (88%).</p><p>In second place is current defence secretary Ben Wallace, with a similar proportion (84%) wanting him in cabinet. He is likewise popular with both camps in the leadership debate (81% of Sunak supporters and 82% of Truss supporters).</p><p>Two-thirds of Conservative members want to see former leadership hopeful and current attorney general Suella Braverman given a role in the forthcoming cabinet – including 75% of those supporting Truss for party leader but far fewer Sunak supporters (53%).</p><p>Other previous leadership contenders Tom Tugendhat and Penny Mordaunt are also popular choices for cabinet roles (both 63%).</p><p>A similar proportion of members want to see Jacob Rees-Mogg continue as a cabinet minister (62%). However, the minister of Brexit opportunities and government efficiency divides the two competing leadership factions. While 80% of those backing Truss for party leader say they want him in cabinet, only 36% of Sunak supporters say the same – a 44-point difference.</p><p>Six in ten party members say the current deputy prime minister Dominic Raab (61%), and the home secretary Priti Patel (60%) should be included in the new cabinet. While Sunak and Truss's supporters feel similarly about Raab, they disagree over Patel’s future. Seven in ten Truss backers (71%) want her in the future cabinet, versus fewer than half of Sunak’s backers (46%).</p><p>Around half of party members think that the current, as well as the former chancellor of the exchequer Nadhim Zahawi (55%) and Sajid Javid (53%), should be given cabinet positions. Javid is another figure who splits the membership, although in this case he proves more popular among backers of Sunak, with 75% of this group wanting him in the cabinet, versus 38% of Truss supporters.</p><p>Nadine Doris divides the entire membership, with the 42% wanting to see her included in the next cabinet counterbalanced by the 42% who do not. Truss supporters are twice as likely as those backing Sunak to say Dorries should be in the next cabinet (57% versus 24%).</p><p>When it comes to Boris Johnson, only 40% of members overall want to see him in the next prime minister's cabinet team, while 50% do not. Liz Truss has said she thinks it was <a href=#>wrong to oust Johnson</a> from Number 10, but despite this she has also suggested <a href=#>he would not have a role in her cabinet</a>. However, half (55%) of party members supporting her run for leader say he should be in the next cabinet. Only 18% of those backing Sunak say the same.</p><p>Finally, former health secretary Jeremy Hunt proves to be the least popular choice for a cabinet position, as only 31% of Conservatives say he should be in the next cabinet. However, this does rise to half (53%) among Sunak’s support base, while only 18% of Truss’s supporters agree.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p>Header image: Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGh%2Fd4GMsJ%2BoZZSkeqS7zaycq66Rqba3sYypmKusqWK6prnBnqmsZaeWu7V5wpqZoqaVqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-men-get-so-so-angry-when-theyre-cheated-on.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why do men get so, so angry when they're cheated on?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./la-ddmarche-une-methodologie-participative-et-operationnelle-commpte-rendu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>une mthodologie participative et oprationnelle (compte-rendu)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

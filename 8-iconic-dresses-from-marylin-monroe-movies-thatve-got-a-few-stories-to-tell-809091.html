And at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the article, we’re going to&nbsp;tell you what trick Marilyn used to&nbsp;wear the legendary semi-transparent dress she sang “Happy Birthday” in.</p><p><h2><i>The Seven Year Itch</i>, 1955</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/897/d7f/ddefad5e37aedd583c42bb5836.jpg><p>Cinema Legacy Collection / The Hollywood Archive / The / agefotostock / East News<span>, </span>Cinema Legacy Collection / The Hollywood Archive / The / agefotostock / East News</p><ul><li>Even people who haven’t seen the film have probably heard about the famous scene from&nbsp;it. The episode was initially <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shot</a> right in&nbsp;the subway, and it&nbsp;took 14&nbsp;takes. Even though it&nbsp;was late at&nbsp;night, there were a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bystanders watching. So, the best take was ruined by&nbsp;the noise, and the final version had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;filmed in&nbsp;the studio.</li><li>Among the people in&nbsp;the crowd, there was a&nbsp;baseball player Joe DiMaggio, who was the actress’ husband at&nbsp;the time. There’s a&nbsp;rumor that he&nbsp;really disliked what he&nbsp;saw, and they broke up&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the dress. In&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;infuriate her husband even more, Monroe wore 2&nbsp;sets of&nbsp;underwear.</li><li>Famous designer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>William Travilla</a> worked on&nbsp;this film. An&nbsp;interesting fact is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;didn’t like the dress, he&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was silly. After he&nbsp;died, the sketch of&nbsp;the dress was sold for $50,000. And in&nbsp;2011, the dress itself was purchased for $5.52&nbsp;million, the most money ever paid for a&nbsp;movie costume.</li></ul><p><h2><i>Some Like It&nbsp;Hot</i>, 1959</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/384/b2e/a3ff335d77996c0faf2d5ca27f.jpg><p>Image supplied by Capital Pictures / East News</p><ul><li>Even though Monroe was pregnant during the filming of&nbsp;<i>Some Like It&nbsp;Hot</i>, she wore some pretty revealing costumes. By&nbsp;the way, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>costumes</a>, developed by&nbsp;Orry-Kelly, were so&nbsp;bold for that time that the film was even banned in&nbsp;some regions. But it&nbsp;didn’t stop Orry-Kelly from winning the Academy Award for&nbsp;it.</li><li>The first dress&nbsp;— the close-fitting nude-color <a href=# title=silk data-link=tag>silk</a> cocktail dress, looked a&nbsp;lot like the skin. And if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for the sequins, it&nbsp;would probably not be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the film. An&nbsp;unexpected heart-shaped embroidery detail completes the rear. According to&nbsp;Tony Curtis, the costume designer achieved the sensual fit by&nbsp;literally sewing Monroe into the costumes.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4a/39a/f3cf4b5ba6a909fd61fa687a5e.jpg><p>UNITED ARTISTS / Album / East News<span>, </span>East News</p><ul><li>Another one of&nbsp;his creations was a&nbsp;semi-transparent black <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> with beads and sequins, scattered beaded butterfly appliques, and beaded fringe. The dress has a&nbsp;built-in bra, even though it&nbsp;seems the actress is&nbsp;not wearing any underwear. Legend has it&nbsp;that Monroe had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;lifted to&nbsp;the piano for this scene, as&nbsp;the dress was very form-fitting.</li></ul><p><h2><i>The Prince and The Showgirl</i>, 1957</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/71d/0fb/0574055e1896402cbad90f69da.jpg><p>Mary Evans / AF Archive / East News<span>, </span>WARNER BROTHERS / Album / East News</p><ul><li>The costumes for <i>The Prince and The Showgirl</i>, including the tight beaded ivory dress, were made by&nbsp;British costume designer Beatrice Dawson. Working on&nbsp;this project was a&nbsp;huge challenge for her because, during filming, Monroe’s weight <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fluctuated</a> constantly, so&nbsp;Beatrice had no&nbsp;choice but to&nbsp;make several identical dresses in&nbsp;different sizes.</li><li>Besides, Marilyn would often stain the costumes with food, and the outfits would have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;replaced. Finally, Beatrice found a&nbsp;solution by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remaking</a> the dress so&nbsp;that, when needed, just the top layer could be&nbsp;replaced.</li></ul><p><h2><i>Something’s Got to&nbsp;Give</i>, 1962</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/27a/194/bbd8905e4cb7d9e5b749b94e12.jpg><p>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation / Collection Christophel / East News<span>, </span>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation / Collection Christophel / East News</p><ul><li>The silk crepe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> with a&nbsp;floral print, developed by&nbsp;Hollywood costume designer Jean Louis, was special because it&nbsp;was created for the last film with Marilyn. The film was never released: first she was fired from the film, and when the studio hired her again, she passed away. The filmed materials were included in&nbsp;a&nbsp;documentary about the actress, and the “cursed” dress was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> at&nbsp;the auction for $358,000.</li></ul><p><h2><i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>, 1953</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/351/ae9/75ffe55869ae0b91fdf081a231.jpg><p>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation / Collection Christophel / East News<span>, </span>Mary Evans / AF Archive / East News</p><ul><li>The beaded orange <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> was one of&nbsp;the highlights of&nbsp;<i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>. The simple look had an&nbsp;unusual construction: the zip was in&nbsp;the front, and, for the skirt to&nbsp;retain its shape, it&nbsp;had boning on&nbsp;the sides.</li><li>The fiery color produced a&nbsp;bombshell. Marilyn loved the dress so&nbsp;much that she asked the designer, who was also her close friend, William Travilla, to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;copy for her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;salmon color. And the original dress went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different project: 3&nbsp;years later, jazz singer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Abbey Lincoln</a> wore it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the musical <i>The Girl Can’t Help&nbsp;It</i>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/162/1d5/49a923595aab829aac7cf3748f.jpg><ul><li>For the performance of&nbsp;Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe, Billy (the name William was called by&nbsp;his friends and colleagues) developed red sequin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>gowns</a> with high slits up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the hip and deep cleavage.</li><li>If&nbsp;you look closely, you will see that there’s a&nbsp;nude-color lining in&nbsp;the cleavage area. The designer used this trick to&nbsp;make the actresses feel confident. The many decorative elements were sewn to&nbsp;the costumes, so&nbsp;the actresses could move freely while dancing.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebf/dfd/bd2818558a9c5b9b2f5e3a6872.jpg><p>20TH CENTURY FOX / Album / East News<span>, </span>East News</p><ul><li>The gold pleated gown was also specially made for <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>. It&nbsp;was based on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ginger Rogers’s</a> dress from <i>Dreamboat</i>. Marilyn saw the gown hanging in&nbsp;Billy’s office and wanted one for her. The designer just couldn’t refuse.</li><li>The dress wasn’t finished in&nbsp;time for the filming, so&nbsp;Marilyn had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;sewn into&nbsp;it. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dress</a> was created out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single complete circle of&nbsp;gold lame. There was an&nbsp;iron V-build in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the dress from the waist to&nbsp;the bust&nbsp;— creating the molding effect. But the dress ended up&nbsp;being so&nbsp;bold that all the scenes with it&nbsp;were deleted. There’s only a&nbsp;short 10-second episode, where the dress can be&nbsp;seen from the back.</li><li>Monroe loved the dress, like many other William’s creations, so&nbsp;much, that she wanted to&nbsp;wear it&nbsp;for the 1953 Photoplay Awards. Travilla was not happy. He&nbsp;felt that the dress was for a&nbsp;movie, not for a&nbsp;public appearance. But Monroe didn’t listen and wore&nbsp;it, causing a&nbsp;total sensation, making Joan Crawford exclaim, “She looks vulgar”!</li></ul><p><h2>Bonus: The famous sparking dress</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aec/bc2/4fbe565393ad991998b8b8ec0e.jpg><p>AP / East News<span>, </span>LFI / Avalon.red / REPORTER / East News</p><p>The semi-transparent nude-color dress that Marilyn sang “Happy Birthday” in, is&nbsp;probably the most famous piece of&nbsp;clothing from the 20th century. When Monroe <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>asked</a> costume designer Jean Louis to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;dress for her, she told him, “I&nbsp;want you to&nbsp;design a&nbsp;truly <a href=# title=historical data-link=tag>historical</a> dress, a&nbsp;dazzling dress that’s one-of-a-kind, a&nbsp;dress that only Marilyn Monroe could wear.”</p><p>When the gown was created, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the actress decided not to&nbsp;wear anything</a> under&nbsp;it, for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;fit her perfectly. She told the organizers of&nbsp;the event that she’d wear a&nbsp;simple dress with a&nbsp;tall collar. But then, she went on&nbsp;the stage, took her white fur coat off, and everyone was stunned.</p><p>Which Marilyn Monroe dress do&nbsp;you like the most?

My&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I listened to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and got really freaked out. And it&nbsp;wasn’t until she enrolled in&nbsp;university that we&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;recognize this language. Turned out, it&nbsp;was Finnish.

The old man would tell him about cows and tractors, etc. I&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;he&nbsp;scared him, and he&nbsp;said&nbsp;no, that he&nbsp;was nice, just wanted to&nbsp;keep him company until he&nbsp;fell asleep.<br>Fast-forward to&nbsp;looking through photos with mum, and my&nbsp;son gets excited and points out the old man who talks to&nbsp;him while he&nbsp;falls asleep. It&nbsp;was my&nbsp;mother’s father who passed away when she was 18. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;dairy farmer.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;kyles05&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>A&nbsp;few weeks ago, I&nbsp;was getting <a href=# title=breakfast data-link=tag>breakfast</a> ready for my&nbsp;3-year-old when he&nbsp;nonchalantly told me&nbsp;his grandma fell down the stairs.

When my&nbsp;wife approached him, he&nbsp;tilted his head to&nbsp;the side and stared at&nbsp;her. She asked him what he&nbsp;was doing, and he&nbsp;said, “Looking for my&nbsp;baby sister in&nbsp;your tummy.” Later we&nbsp;found out that she was 2&nbsp;weeks pregnant at&nbsp;the time, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;girl.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Jmersh&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;came home one day to&nbsp;find my&nbsp;wife in&nbsp;a&nbsp;panic. Our daughter was about 15&nbsp;months old and could speak some words. My&nbsp;wife said that the baby was seeing a&nbsp;man.<br>When asked, “Is&nbsp;the man nice?” She answered, “No.” I&nbsp;laughed, called my&nbsp;daughter, and asked her, “Where’s the man?” She pointed at&nbsp;the entrance. “Is&nbsp;the man nice?” “No.” “Is&nbsp;the man behind the door?” “No.”<br>“Where is&nbsp;he?” She pointed at&nbsp;the entrance again. I&nbsp;didn’t show&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I felt really uncomfortable. Either it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a href=# title=fantasy data-link=tag>fantasy</a>, or&nbsp;it&nbsp;was the man who had lived in&nbsp;this apartment before&nbsp;us.&nbsp;©&nbsp;HarbingerOne&nbsp;/ Pikabu</li><li>A&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;mine told me&nbsp;that her son (who was&nbsp;4) would tell her things like, “My&nbsp;<a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a> mom never made me&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;my&nbsp;room.” She asked her son some more about this, and apparently they lived for 10,000 years on&nbsp;Mars before he&nbsp;was born to&nbsp;her.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;rebble_yell&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>My&nbsp;9-year-old son said once that he&nbsp;could see many spirits in&nbsp;the cloudless summer sky, in&nbsp;the form of&nbsp;colorful balloons.

One night while she was getting ready for bed, I&nbsp;overheard her talking to&nbsp;someone in&nbsp;her room. I&nbsp;poked my&nbsp;head in&nbsp;and asked if&nbsp;she was calling for&nbsp;me.

My&nbsp;4-year-old son would often point at&nbsp;the window and say that there was a&nbsp;man standing there. I’d ask him, “What man?” And he’d answer, “He’s tall and has blond hair.”<br>And he’d see him when it&nbsp;was dark outside. He’d call out to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and point his finger at&nbsp;the window. When I&nbsp;asked him, “Where is&nbsp;he?” He’d say, “He’s gone, he&nbsp;got scared of&nbsp;you.” I’d even hurry outside, but there’d be&nbsp;no&nbsp;one there either.&nbsp;©&nbsp;Anna.Renz&nbsp;/ Pikabu</li><li>My&nbsp;then 2-year-old daughter used to&nbsp;scream in&nbsp;the night, and told my&nbsp;wife and I&nbsp;it was because she was visited by&nbsp;a&nbsp;lady. A&nbsp;few weeks later, she stopped screaming.<br>Offhandedly, I&nbsp;asked if&nbsp;the lady had stopped coming. She answered, “No, she’s just nice now. Her name is&nbsp;Shelia.

She heard her daughter talking to&nbsp;someone in&nbsp;the room. She went in&nbsp;and asked, “Did you call&nbsp;me?” She replied, “No, I&nbsp;was saying goodbye to&nbsp;my&nbsp;other mom.” My&nbsp;friend, “What other mom?”<br>And the girl whispered, “She is&nbsp;an&nbsp;old woman. She sometimes comes to&nbsp;me, tells me&nbsp;stories, and sings. And she asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;call her mom.” After that my&nbsp;friend couldn’t sleep for a&nbsp;week, she even had to&nbsp;consult a&nbsp;therapist. They calmed her down, they said that children like to&nbsp;imagine things at&nbsp;this age.</li></ul><p>If&nbsp;you don’t believe in&nbsp;supernatural things, then stories about ghostly men and flying women will probably just make you laugh.

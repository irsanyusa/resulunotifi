Some say it’s so&nbsp;grand that it’s visible from space; others claim that you can see it&nbsp;from as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a>. Other theories suggest that the builders of&nbsp;the wall were left inside.</p><p>Sorry to&nbsp;disappoint you, but all these impressive stories are just myths. But even with those stories busted, the Great Wall of&nbsp;China is&nbsp;an&nbsp;impressive and truly breathtaking structure, so&nbsp;let me&nbsp;tell you its true story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/206/c4d/a17c38598bae92990e83c2c3e7.png><p>Today, China is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most populated countries in&nbsp;the world, counting as&nbsp;many as&nbsp;1.4 billion residents. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also one of&nbsp;the oldest nations in&nbsp;the world&nbsp;— it&nbsp;has 3,500 years of&nbsp;continuous written history, but the civilization existed long before that! There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;theory that while the European continent, for example, was most likely reached by&nbsp;humans from Africa, China wasn’t populated by&nbsp;settlers that came from somewhere else. Some people believe that the Chinese civilization was formed by&nbsp;local Stone Age people, who lived on&nbsp;the territory since the prehistoric period.</p><p>So&nbsp;now, the Great Wall of&nbsp;China. It’s truly big even by&nbsp;today’s standard&nbsp;— stretching for over 13,000&nbsp;miles. To&nbsp;imagine it&nbsp;better, it’s almost five times the distance between <a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> and <a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a>. Or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;bit greater than the distance between North and South Poles. Even in&nbsp;modern times, people have never built anything close to&nbsp;this big.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;didn’t take a&nbsp;day to&nbsp;build the Great Wall of&nbsp;China. Two? Keep going. In&nbsp;fact, the wall was being built for centuries. Maybe you know that ancient cities had walls around them to&nbsp;protect themselves from invaders. Yes, Chinese cities had them too. The first Chinese Emperor united the country in&nbsp;220&nbsp;BCE and got a&nbsp;brilliant but very ambitious idea: to&nbsp;turn all city walls into one big wall that would defend the country’s border against attacks from the north.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/5d6/ffe/1a30775864a8bbb473e725532a.png><p>A&nbsp;trusted general directed the construction, enrolling a&nbsp;big group of&nbsp;workers: soldiers, commoners, and convicts. Back then, the wall was built of&nbsp;rammed earth and <a href=# title=wood data-link=tag>wood</a>. In&nbsp;some places that were strategically important, the sections of&nbsp;the wall overlapped to&nbsp;provide maximum security. The walls were around 26&nbsp;feet high, on&nbsp;average.</p><p>But the Great Wall didn’t yet look like the construction we&nbsp;know today. Every next emperor would pick up&nbsp;the big wall project, strengthening and extending&nbsp;it, repairing, but also modernizing construction techniques. Some used bricks to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it; some moved on&nbsp;to&nbsp;granite and marble blocks.</p><p>Watchtowers and platforms weren’t there from the beginning as&nbsp;well: they were added by&nbsp;Ming emperors. The watchtowers made it&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;communicate with the other parts of&nbsp;the wall through <a href=# title=smoke data-link=tag>smoke</a> and fire messages. So, the wall is&nbsp;quite inconsistent in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;material, but it&nbsp;only adds more charm to&nbsp;the construction and shows how much effort and time it&nbsp;took.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b6b/53e/fddbeb5419b6f71335fd763670.png><p>The reason why some parts of&nbsp;the wall have been standing for centuries and are still in&nbsp;good condition is&nbsp;glutinous rice flour. Turns out, this sticky rice mortar is&nbsp;almost like cement&nbsp;— it’s very strong and waterproof, sealing the bricks so&nbsp;tightly together that even sneaky weeds can’t grow between them.</p><p>You may also notice that some bricks have writings carved on&nbsp;them&nbsp;— they were left by&nbsp;the workers who were building the wall. The purpose of&nbsp;those writings is&nbsp;quality assurance: they contain such information as&nbsp;location, quantity, and responsible officials. So, in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;some problems with the quality of&nbsp;materials or&nbsp;constructions, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;known who should be&nbsp;held accountable for&nbsp;it.</p><p>Recently, a&nbsp;research group has looked through official historical documents of&nbsp;the Ming Dynasty that ruled China from the 14th to&nbsp;the 17th century. They came across records of&nbsp;secret doors in&nbsp;the Great Wall. So, they decided to&nbsp;find them. They used a&nbsp;flying robot to&nbsp;capture continuous centimeter-resolution photos of&nbsp;the wall. They photographed&nbsp;90% of&nbsp;the wall that was built during the Ming Dynasty and discovered the remains of&nbsp;over 220 secret doors along the wall. Some of&nbsp;them have a&nbsp;specific width and height that allows only one person to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through. Others are large enough to&nbsp;allow two horses to&nbsp;pass at&nbsp;the same time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9e3/0e9/2e86e853639066b363f115dc79.png><p>Why are the doors there? The Great Wall’s main goal was to&nbsp;protect the country from the enemy. Building doors that could let the enemy in&nbsp;would undermine the whole point of&nbsp;having a&nbsp;wall. So, of&nbsp;course, the doors were secret passages. They perfectly matched the surroundings topographically, and the exit on&nbsp;the outside was camouflaged with bricks so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was almost completely indistinguishable from the brick wall.</p><p>The wall was never just a&nbsp;defensive wall, and it&nbsp;was never completely closed&nbsp;— it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;opened on&nbsp;demand. It&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;structure used for trade and commerce, communication between inside and outside the wall, and, of&nbsp;course, for defense and spying. Some doors were used for trade with the other side. Through smaller doors, a&nbsp;person would sneak out to&nbsp;spy on&nbsp;the enemy that lived on&nbsp;the other side.</p><p>The hidden gates were also useful for a&nbsp;sudden attack. As&nbsp;you remember, some gates were camouflaged with brick on&nbsp;the outside&nbsp;— the exit was so&nbsp;indistinguishable that the enemy had no&nbsp;idea where exactly it&nbsp;was located. The inside entrance for Chinese soldiers was hollow: so&nbsp;they could walk through the wall and break the camouflaged exit gate from the inside, starting their surprise attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3cf/cda/9633175d24acbe9338f0fc3571.png><p>Even though the main point was to&nbsp;prevent outsiders from getting into the city, the wall wasn’t too effective on&nbsp;that matter. It&nbsp;could still be&nbsp;climbed over or&nbsp;marched around. So, the wall was being watched at&nbsp;all times, and guards gave signals to&nbsp;the troops if&nbsp;they saw the enemy approach. Also, the wall provided more time to&nbsp;mobilize and bulk up&nbsp;the country’s forces or&nbsp;lure the enemy troops into a&nbsp;difficult strategic position. The construction stopped at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 19th century&nbsp;— the wall lost its strategic and military importance due to&nbsp;technological advances.</p><p>Over the centuries to&nbsp;today, only&nbsp;8% of&nbsp;the Great Wall is&nbsp;in&nbsp;good condition, and the rest is&nbsp;damaged. Also, around 1/3 of&nbsp;the wall has disappeared without a&nbsp;trace due to&nbsp;both natural erosion and human damage. I&nbsp;guess you could say it’s now just a&nbsp;“pretty good wall”. As&nbsp;you remember, the first parts of&nbsp;the wall were built out of&nbsp;rammed earth and wood. These are not the most unfailing materials if&nbsp;we’re talking about thousands of&nbsp;years. Also, destructive farming methods turned large areas into a&nbsp;desert and contributed to&nbsp;erosion.</p><p>Also, many bricks were taken away from the wall in&nbsp;the last century to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used in&nbsp;building farms and houses. The wall is&nbsp;being deconstructed stone by&nbsp;stone even today, but this time, by&nbsp;tourists: quite a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;them take a&nbsp;stone as&nbsp;a&nbsp;souvenir. That’s a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stones, considering that over 10&nbsp;million tourists visit the Great Wall every year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/aaa/a49/54343859808a4e92507a8ee54c.png><p>Since 1987, the wall has been a&nbsp;UNESCO World Heritage Site, highlighting that it&nbsp;has an&nbsp;outstanding importance to&nbsp;humanity. The wall is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;China’s 56&nbsp;world heritage sites —2nd place among countries with landmarks protected by&nbsp;UNESCO. Who’s first, you ask? The top spot, with 58&nbsp;world heritage sites, belongs to&nbsp;Italy.</p><p>And do&nbsp;you know that the wall isn’t only a&nbsp;famous tourist attraction, but also the location of&nbsp;the Great Wall marathon? It’s a&nbsp;marathon that was established in&nbsp;1999 and is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most challenging ones in&nbsp;the world. You guessed it&nbsp;right&nbsp;— people run along the wall, including all the steps. There are three distances, so&nbsp;the participants can run a&nbsp;full marathon that is&nbsp;26&nbsp;miles, a&nbsp;half-marathon that’s 13&nbsp;miles, or&nbsp;just have a&nbsp;fun run of&nbsp;5&nbsp;miles.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsdhmnaitnpl6sMLEq2Str59itba6w6ucnWWYnrGlsc1mm6inoqh6qrqMrZ%2BeZZensqLAjLCYpaRdpLNur8eipZplaGaCdX%2BRaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-mushrooms-grow-in-circles-and-14-phenomena-that-defy-all-logic-815389.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why Mushrooms Grow in Circles and 14 Phenomena That Defy All Logic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./fabriques-de-territoires-les-29-laureats-de-lami-sajoutent-aux-189-deja-labellises.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>les 29 laurats de l'AMI s'ajoutent aux 189 dj labelliss</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

In what seems like a twisted turn of fate for pregnant people, each day that passes you tend to find yourself a little more tired and a little less able to find a restful night of sleep. That’s why, along with stocking up on maternity clothes, it’s smart to invest in a pregnancy pillow.</p><p>Here, we’re rounding up the best pregnancy pillows, of all shapes and sizes, that will help you get the comfortable, nourishing sleep you need in the final months of pregnancy.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-pregnancy-pillows>Our top picks for the best pregnancy pillows</h2><h3>Best J-shaped / Best budget pregnancy pillow: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Momcozy J Shaped Maternity Body Pillow</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best J-shaped / Best budget pregnancy pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Momcozy J Shaped Maternity Body Pillow</h3></p><p>This traditional J-shaped pregnancy pillow is a perennial favorite for a number of reasons. It’s large enough to provide support for the belly and between the legs, yet not so big that it takes over your entire bed. You can use it beneath your head if you like, or easily continue sleeping on your existing pillow (if yours is in need of a replacement, check out our guide to the best pillows).

I’m a hybrid sleeper, often falling asleep on my side or stomach and waking up on my back, and I’m sleeping much more soundly knowing that this pillow will catch me if I roll over. I love that I can face the long side if I want a large pillow to snuggle around or face the small side if I want to lean back a bit and still have support for my belly. I also really like how the stuffing is sectioned out, so I can curve the lower part of the pillow up between my legs or keep it longer if I want to stretch out a little. This pillow truly supports every sleeping position.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill type: Polyester</li><li>Shape: J-shaped</li><li>Dimensions: 54 inches x 30 inches x 7 inches</li><li>Firmness: Medium soft</li><li>Care instructions: Removable machine washable cover</li><li>Price at publication: $70</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>This pillow is super versatile</li><li>It’s not overstuffed, so you can contour it to your body</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>It can get a little warm with it under the comforter</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Perfect for hybrid sleepers, this pillow successfully supports every sleeping position.</p><h3>Best wedge pregnancy pillow: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Hiccapop Pregnancy Pillow Wedge</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wedge pregnancy pillow</span></p><p><h3 class=title>hiccapop Pregnancy Pillow Wedge for Maternity | Memory Foam Maternity Pillows Support Body, Belly, Back, Knees</h3></p><p>There are loads of benefits to a wedge pillow. It supports your belly while taking up virtually no space in your bed, eliminating pressure on your lower back. If you’re usually a stomach sleeper, it will keep you from rolling too far forward, causing discomfort. While many people use a wedge pillow under their belly, it’s also perfect for tucking between your knees or behind your back, depending on what you need. This pick is also budget-friendly and available from Amazon (which made our list of one of the best places to buy pillows), so the stakes are low if you’ve never tried a wedge pillow before.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill type: Memory foam</li><li>Shape: Wedge</li><li>Dimensions: 15 inches x 13 inches x 5 inches</li><li>Firmness: Medium hard</li><li>Care instructions: Removable machine washable cover</li><li>Price at publication: $26</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>A great entry point if you need support, but aren’t ready to commit to a larger pillow</li><li>Memory foam molds to your body without ever going flat</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>As you get closer to delivery, it may not be enough support</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Small, soft and supportive, it’s the ideal wedge pillow.</p><h3>Best pregnancy pillow for back pain and back sleepers: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Belly Bandit S.O.S.

Unlike the large, full body pillows on this list, it features two foam-filled wedge pillows, one shaped to support the belly and the other shaped to support the back, that you secure using Velcro along a belt at the exact positions you need to keep you comfortably on your side and prevent you from rolling onto your back.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Fill type: Polyurethane</li><li>Shape: Double wedge</li><li>Dimensions: N/A</li><li>Firmness: Medium hard</li><li>Care instructions: Removable machine washable (on hand wash) cover</li><li>Price at publication: $90</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>It provides support for the back and belly without being very big</li><li>The taller back pillow essentially guarantees that you can’t roll over</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t provide the cozy cocoon that full body pillows do</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A unique and effective pillow designed specifically for back support.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-pregnancy-pillow-for-you>How to choose the best pregnancy pillow for you</h2><p>There’s more to a good pillow than just size. Here’s what else to think about before you make your purchase:</p><h3>Preferred sleeping position</h3><p>When you’re not pregnant, are you a side, back, stomach, or combination sleeper? If you’re already a side sleeper, you may only need a small or moderately supportive pillow to help you balance on your side. If you’re a back sleeper, you likely want a pillow that will keep you from rolling off your side and onto your back in the middle of the night. If you’re a stomach sleeper, you might need a wedge to support your belly and counteract your tendency to roll forward. If you sleep in a variety of positions, you are going to want a pillow that can accommodate that.</p><h3>Pregnancy ailments</h3><p>From back pain and joint pain, to round ligament pain, the right pregnancy pillow can help counteract these aches and allow you to get much-needed, restful sleep. Where your pain resides will determine whether you look for a pillow with more back support, belly support, or leg and hip support.</p><h3>Bed and pillow size</h3><p>Some pregnancy pillows, especially U-shaped pillows, can get pretty huge. If you get claustrophobic, have a smaller bed, or even a large dog that sleeps with you, your mattress could get crowded pretty fast once you add a pregnancy pillow to the mix. That’s why it’s key to take both your bed size and pillow size into account when making your pick. Likewise, consider whether you want to continue using your regular pillow or if you’re ok with resting your head on the pregnancy pillow. If you get a larger one, you’ll likely be doing the latter.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-pregnancy-pillows>How we chose the best pregnancy pillows</h2><p>To choose the best pregnancy pillows, I used my own experience with pregnancy and pregnancy pillows to narrow down the best options. I also talked to other moms (just like I did to find the best travel strollers) to find out what pillows they used during their pregnancies and what they loved about them, as well as sought advice from pregnancy experts. I then compiled all of this input into a final list of the best pregnancy pillows.</p><h2 id=best-way-to-sleep-with-a-pregnancy-pillow>Best way to sleep with a pregnancy pillow</h2><p>The best way to sleep with a pregnancy pillow is the way that you feel most comfortable and that allows you to get the most restful sleep. Most pregnant people are looking for support for their back, under their belly or between their legs. Depending on the size and shape of the pillow you choose, one pillow can deliver support at all of these places. If you don’t need support in specific areas (say you’re not a back sleeper, so you don’t need a pillow behind you to prevent you from rolling over), you can sleep with the pillow only delivering support where you need it.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What month should I get a pregnancy pillow?</h3><p>“Most pregnant people will start to consider a pregnancy pillow when they begin having discomfort while sleeping or lying down. For many pregnant folks that will be after their 20-week mark,” Jordan says. Especially if it’s your first pregnancy, you might want to wait until then to make your pick. “I suggest getting pillows at this point and not in the beginning as you'll have a better grasp of what you are feeling and what will be more helpful to getting you more comfortable rest time,” Jordan adds.</p><h3>Is a C- or U-shaped pillow better for pregnancy?</h3><p>While the best pillow is the one that you find most comfortable and the one that helps you sleep best, Jordan is partial to the C-shaped pillows for a few reasons. “I think it provides more back, neck, and shoulder support and gives more of a cuddle feeling than the U-shaped design which I find feels cumbersome and oddly shaped when you are already not as agile as your pre-pregnancy state,” she says. “They are also enormous! Every pregnant person knows the feeling of finally getting into a comfortable position only to have to go to the bathroom ten minutes later. The last thing you need is to have to untangle yourself from the elephant sized U-shaped pillow design on top of that!”</p><h3>Why do you put a pillow between your legs when pregnant?</h3><p>There are a few reasons having a pillow between your legs is helpful when you’re pregnant. First, because your belly is pulling your center of gravity toward the front of your body, it can create a pulling/pressure sensation on your top leg when you’re lying on your side that a pillow can alleviate. “It can take much-needed pressure off your tired joints and improve circulation,” adds Jordan, “so not only will you sleep better, but you also feel more rested when you wake up.”</p><h3>What is the difference between a J and U pregnancy pillow?</h3><p>Simply look at the letters and you will see the difference. With a U-shaped pregnancy pillow, you would sleep inside the U and have part of the pillow on either side of your body. With a J-shaped pillow, you will only have the pillow on one side.</p><h3>When should I stop lying on my back during pregnancy?</h3><p>“Most physicians will state that pregnant mothers begin side lying from 28 weeks,” Jordan says. “Sleeping on your back can lead to a reduction of oxygenated blood and circulation that could lead to poor transfer of needed oxygen and blood to the placenta which keeps the baby healthy and safe.” Sleeping on your back late in your pregnancy can compress the vena cava, a major blood vessel that runs down the back. This can affect the baby’s oxygen supply and even potentially lead to complications.</p><h3>What is the best pregnancy sleeping position?</h3><p>The best pregnancy sleeping position is technically on your left side, says Jordan. “This is to create more circulation and nutrient-packed oxygenated blood to your placenta and baby. It also prevents less pressure on your liver as your body grows with a baby.” That said, if you can only get comfortable on your right side, that is still preferable to sleeping on your back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loKeyqLrAp5qyZaCeua271qxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./emmaus-connect-et-lagence-du-numerique-partenaires-pour-lutter-contre-lexclusion-numerique.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Emmas Connect et l'Agence du numrique partenaires pour lutter contre l'exclusion numrique</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1577770-inventive-book-club-names-friends.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>250+ inventive book club names for you and your friends</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

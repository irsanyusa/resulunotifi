Why do&nbsp;they look adult and serious at&nbsp;that age, while you still look young and fresh? There are a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;logical explanations for this and it’s true that humankind really looks younger year-by-year.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>became interested in&nbsp;the differences in&nbsp;the looks between generations and decided to&nbsp;figure out why today’s 25-year-olds look much younger than their parents at&nbsp;the same age.</p><p><h2>Biological aging slows down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f43/25d/0177a6506da5c9590ec1fa1030.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;found a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;me&nbsp;&&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom at&nbsp;the same age.”</p><p>It’s not only the concept of&nbsp;aging that has <a href=#>changed</a>: 150-200 years ago a&nbsp;50-year-old person was considered old and today they are called middle-aged. Have you noticed that some people already have gray hair and little <a href=# title=wrinkles data-link=tag>wrinkles</a> around the age of&nbsp;30, while others still look like school kids at&nbsp;the same age? It’s all because every person has their own biological clock, that rarely coincides with their real age. American researchers have come to&nbsp;the <a href=#>conclusion</a> that biological aging in&nbsp;recent years has been happening more slowly, which is&nbsp;why subsequent generations stay younger looking longer.</p><p><h2>Women give birth to&nbsp;kids at&nbsp;a&nbsp;later age, that’s why they look young.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b67/9f1/b23bd65fd48b61ca83fc35877e.jpg><p>“From left to&nbsp;right: my&nbsp;grandma, my&nbsp;mom, and&nbsp;me, all around the same age.”</p><p>The results of&nbsp;recent studies <a href=#>prove</a> that after giving birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;baby, women really start to&nbsp;age faster. The reason is&nbsp;not only due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant feeling of&nbsp;tiredness and stress, which always accompanies the first months of&nbsp;caring for a&nbsp;child, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;caring for their future. It&nbsp;turns out that after birth, changes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman’s body happen at&nbsp;the cellular level.</p><p>Today women are more ambitious. They try to&nbsp;dedicate more time to&nbsp;their career or&nbsp;business and only after that do&nbsp;they create a&nbsp;family. That’s why external signs of&nbsp;aging appear much later.</p><p><h2>The level of&nbsp;dental care has improved.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16d/8cf/0a7f315bdfa688fec446389744.jpg><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>direct connection</a> between the condition of&nbsp;our teeth and the oval of&nbsp;our face. Our cheeks and lips lean on&nbsp;our teeth and jaws, that’s why the absence of&nbsp;teeth or&nbsp;damaged teeth literally spoils the face oval. Of&nbsp;course, our cheeks become saggy with age and our lips become thinner&nbsp;— these are natural changes that only plastic surgery can change. At&nbsp;the same time, a&nbsp;simple malocclusion can make it&nbsp;look much worse. That’s why regular visits to&nbsp;the dentist really help&nbsp;us to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;beautiful face shape for longer.</p><p>Today’s level of&nbsp;dentistry allows you to&nbsp;fix any shortcomings that our parents had to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with. In&nbsp;addition, the results of&nbsp;dental work lasts much longer now because medicine has become better, and specialists have become more educated.</p><p><h2>Cosmetics with SPF have appeared.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1f/b89/a0e40155589337471da8cdc73b.jpg><p>The quality and choice of&nbsp;<a href=# title=cosmetics data-link=tag>cosmetics</a> change every year, while proper and regular skincare is&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;everyday routine for most women. At&nbsp;the same time, sun protection filters are not only present in&nbsp;sunscreen oils, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“SPF”</a> can now be&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;moisturizing creams, makeup bases, and even makeup powders. Since staying protected from the bright sun rays extends the youth of&nbsp;the skin, the appearance of&nbsp;modern women also stays fresh and younger looking for a&nbsp;longer period of&nbsp;time.</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;have more opportunities to&nbsp;have fun.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f1/3c6/b6c4025931aadcea0c35ef4880.jpg><p>Just like laughs, <a href=# title="positive emotions" data-link=tag>positive emotions</a> really <a href=#>prolong</a> our life and even help&nbsp;us to&nbsp;cope with illnesses. Moreover, people with a&nbsp;positive outlook are less prone to&nbsp;stress, which, like any other illness, makes&nbsp;us age and adds more wrinkles.</p><p>Today’s youth has a&nbsp;huge amount of&nbsp;sources for joy, like traveling around the world, doing a&nbsp;job they like (and not what they just managed to&nbsp;get), realizing their creative potential, communicating and making friends with people from different corners of&nbsp;the planet. Now there are many more ways to&nbsp;spend free time&nbsp;— it’s not just about walking and dancing but also kart racing, quest games, and even hot air ballooning. New generations seek to&nbsp;know the world and rejoice, which means they retain the sharpness and clarity of&nbsp;their minds for longer. This reflects in&nbsp;their appearance as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>Young people choose professions that have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with hard physical labor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ac/9e6/77ff155da193f37937b0b5dc39.jpg><p>Young people start to&nbsp;think about their future profession while still in&nbsp;school. They understand that only a&nbsp;demanded specialty can provide a&nbsp;comfortable standard of&nbsp;living. In&nbsp;addition, young people care about their health, which is&nbsp;why they don’t want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;work that might damage their health. That’s the reason we&nbsp;keep <a href=#>seeing</a> more specialists in&nbsp;IT, marketing, and finance. These professions are always in&nbsp;demand and have high pay.</p><p>They also require constant mental stress and development, which, in&nbsp;turn, helps to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;healthy and active brain. Since office-oriented professions exclude hard physical work and harmful working conditions, this type of&nbsp;work does much less damage to&nbsp;our bodies.</p><p><h2>The level of&nbsp;responsibility has decreased.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66e/2e0/27c27c5acea3ae268f71de1892.jpg><p>Despite the fact that young people understand the importance of&nbsp;choosing the right profession and career advancement, they <a href=#>become</a> independent much later. If&nbsp;our parents and grandparents had to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;themselves from a&nbsp;younger age, the following generations stay under the care of&nbsp;their older relatives for much longer.</p><p>All of&nbsp;this happens because today’s youth <a href=#>doesn’t plan</a> their life in&nbsp;advance and continues to&nbsp;stay immature even after 20. Young girls and boys only want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things that they like and they don’t worry about the possible consequences. For example, it’s totally normal for a&nbsp;modern young man to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taking money from his parents while he&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;work or&nbsp;is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;develop his own business. Young men know that they always have a&nbsp;reliable back-up and that’s why they are less prone to&nbsp;worries and depression that is&nbsp;connected with responsibility for the family and financial issues.</p><p>Have you noticed this connection between age and appearance in&nbsp;your relatives? How do&nbsp;you think today’s 30-year-old will look in&nbsp;30&nbsp;more years?

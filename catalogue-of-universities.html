With a portfolio of accomplished projects, our graduates can really show what they can do. Along with Student Council, International Student Association and our Student Societies, students receive an outstanding university experience at Prague City University.</p><h3>Quality teaching</h3><p>With excellent lecturers and small class sizes you'll have plenty of individual time to speak with and learn from your lecturers. In addition, our faculty have plenty to offer students, they have real-world, real-life experience, solid academic qualifications and are accomplished teachers.</p><h3>British accredited and monitored</h3><p>Our accreditation to run university programmes is from Teesside University, consistently ranked one of the top modern British universities for everything from teaching quality to social life (National Student Survey) and winner of multiple higher education awards. Our approval to run other higher and professional education programmes is from Pearson, a British educational authority with international recognition.</p><h3>Great careers</h3><p>In a recent survey, 91% of our graduates found employment or started companies. The remaining 9% enrolled in further studies. Students often find employment through contacts made with companies at Prague City University, and quite often they find career-path employment as early as their second year of studies. Among the major international companies that have employed Prague City University students and graduates are Amazon, DHL, ExxonMobil, Concur, HP, Wunderman, PwC, Fallon, Guerbet and Coca-Cola HBC.</p><h3>Friendly, supportive and international</h3><p>The university offers a close, familiar and yet professional atmosphere. Students come from over 70 countries, including the Czech Republic (about 39%), every European country, every English-speaking country, most Russian-speaking countries, and many other locations in Latin America, Africa and Asia.</p><h3>Excellent facilities</h3><p>Modern, bright and quiet – at Prague City University you will study in excellent conditions. Lecture rooms, studios and computer labs are equipped with PCs and iMacs, with up-to-date software and display technology. Students have access to traditional and digital libraries, as well as campus-wide wi-fi, printing facilities, and outdoor study and refreshment areas. Our online learning platform and full range of digital research resources mean you can continue to study outside the college whenever and wherever you like.</p><h3>Student housing</h3><p>The student residences we work with are great places to live, and somewhere you can really call home. Their convenient locations and ample amenities bring a touch of extra comfort for all students. Accommodation is guaranteed for all our visa-seeking students.</p><h3>City locations</h3><p>Prague City University has three campuses. Our City Centre Campus is directly opposite Masarykovo nádraží in the dynamic new quarter of Masaryčka featuring multinational businesses, cafes, clubs, restaurants and cultural venues. PCU's Bishop’s Court Studios are just a short 5 minute walk away from the City Centre Campus, a dedicated art and design studio, it provides a dynamic space for classes, exhibitions, workshops, and a wide range of creative activities. Pragovka is PCU’s third campus, and in September 2024 will become our main custom-designed campus. Pragovka is in the developing district of Vysočany in Prague 9. Wherever you come from, you’ll enjoy studying in this special environment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Kaq5qkn5zCpnnOn2SuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtfpb%2Bis9SeZJyhpK56trrIr5yrq5mpxg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prince-dead-dave-grohl-david-bowie-snub.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>That Time Dave Grohl Got Snubbed by Prince and David Bowie</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1435589-luna-blaises-biography-age-parents-movies-tv-shows-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Luna Blaises biography: age, parents, movies and TV shows</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

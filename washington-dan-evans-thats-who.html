But on the morning after the election, it turned out that enough people had known who Evans was to enable him to beat the daylights out of Governor Rosellini in a state that went overwhelmingly Democratic in every other way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">W.O.W. Who is Dan Evans? He’s a Republican to keep an eye on. A Seattle-born structural and civil engineer, he began dabbling in precinct politics in 1948, and in 1956 agreed to run for the legislature from a safe district. By 1961 he was the Republican floor leader and he was considered to be one of the most effective parliamentarians in the house.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He was credited with more guts than good sense when he decided to throw himself into the Republican gubernatorial primary this year, for his chief opponent was an evangelistic former preacher named Richard Christensen, who had amassed a zealous Goldwater following, notably including a band of women who paraded around in Indian costumes and called themselves W.O.W.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(Women on the Warpath). Undismayed, Evans ran a tough campaign with emphasis on his earnest and considerable intelligence and a progressive brand of Republicanism. Though the pros counted him out early in the campaign, he pulled ahead and beat Christensen 308,000 to 204,000.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Running against Rosy, however, was something else again. Rosellini’s record as Governor was lackluster, but he was known as a fine, friendly and formidable campaigner. Evans at first appeared withdrawn and diffident. At one point, visiting a highly automated Spokane factory, he spent more time examining the machines than he did shaking hands with workers. “My managers had to push me away,” Evans recalls, adding wistfully: “But those machines were fascinating.”57-Count ‘Em. As the campaign continued, Evans wound up as a public personality, came off to advantage in a series of debates by articulating his moderate Republican stance. He frankly suggested that he would pattern his administration after the successful and vigorous record of G.O.P. Governor Mark Hatfield in neighboring Oregon. He issued a 35-point “Blueprint for Progress”that detailed fresh projects for mental health, for boosting lagging tourism and industry, and for streamlining the state government. He produced photostats purporting to show that state employees had illegally solicited money for Rosy’s 1960 campaign treasure chest-a charge to which Rosellini heatedly objected but never fully replied.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Finally, Evans succeeded in convincing the voters that he was a man of action. “When a Governor goes to Olym-pia,” he told his audiences, “he faces an enormous task. From the day of his inauguration, just 57 crucial days remain in the legislative session-57 days in which to appoint key department heads and remake an entire $2,000,000 budget, 57 days to set the guidelines for two years, 57 days to shape and to pass a new legislative program designed to end drift and dissension and to provide drive and direction. It is a whirlwind 57 days, each one of them crucial, each one of them filled with decisions.-To make good on that man-of-action image, Evans no sooner read the Nov. 3 results than he established a temporary statehouse and appointed a commission to iron out the state’s redistricting problems. “There are two dangerous things which a Governor can do,” says Evans.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“One is to lead with knowledge and without conviction. The other is to lead with conviction and without knowledge.” Obviously, Dan Evans plans to avoid both these dangers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9vbGtiZ4Fww8Csn6Kml6m8r3nDmqVmnaaWu7R506GYratdrLWwew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-pairs-of-celebrities-that-look-like-siblings-from-different-parents-811473.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15+ Celebrities Who Are the Spitting Image of Old Hollywood Icons</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rolling-stones-2024-north-american-tour-dates-1235803009.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rolling Stones Announce 2024 North American Tour Dates</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

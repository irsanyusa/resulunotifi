Inexplicably, the bathroom of the hotel suite we’re in has a glass door. When Julia Roberts announces she needs to go, he gleefully pulls up a chair for a better view before giving Philip Seymour Hoffman a little lecture about turning 40 and getting rid of the extraneous–like, say, smoking. The three Oscar winners have gathered to chat with TIME’s BELINDA LUSCOMBE about their new film Charlie Wilson’s War, written by The West Wing’s Aaron Sorkin, directed by Mike Nichols and produced by Playtone, Hanks’ company. The true story of a large-living Texas Congressman who secretly helped the mujahedin expel the Soviets from Afghanistan, the movie is history played for laughs. The interview played the same way.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TIME: A lot of people probably don’t know much about this story, and I just thought the mujahedin were feisty Afghans who beat the Russians by themselves. Were you aware of it at the time?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TOM HANKS Well, I remember the invasion. I remember President Carter coming out, and there was a big dramatic thing on TV: the Soviet Union has invaded Afghanistan–we were going to cancel the Olympics, and we weren’t going to go to Moscow in 1980. I didn’t realize what the covert action of the CIA had done, and whatnot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">JULIA ROBERTS I was 13. I missed all of this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">PHILIP SEYMOUR HOFFMAN Yeah, I was in junior high in this whole thing. I definitely missed the idea that there was a covert operation going on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Did I say I was 13? Sorry, I meant I was 3.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS I remember thinking that the Soviet Union had done something really stupid, but it was a sign of that classic Soviet aggression machine, the same way that they’d taken over Hungary in 1956 and gone into Czechoslovakia in 1968–that it was those robots that showed up on Lenin’s Tomb every May Day. And I thought, They have made a mistake equal to anything wrong America has done. I remember thinking that it could turn into their Vietnam.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Three months. Did I say 3 years? I meant months.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tom, did you want to play Charlie Wilson from the beginning, or did you …</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Let me tell you, if there’s a movie called Charlie Wilson’s War, guess who I want to play? [Laughter.] If it was called Wee Willy Winky, I want to play Wee Willy Winky. I can’t help it. I am selfish in this manner. What–Phil’s going to play him?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN I’ll play Willy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS From the producerial point of view, I thought I’d be good casting. From an actor’s point of view, I wanted to.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is a movie that makes people think about America and what it has done, especially in the Middle East, and there have been quite a few of those recently, and audiences have not been that drawn to them. Will people go to this one?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN God, I hope they do.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS This isn’t about Iraq.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Well, none of them are really about Iraq.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Oh, no, I think you’re wrong. I think some of them are very specifically about Iraq, and I don’t know if you can make a war movie about Iraq until we have some distance on what has happened in Iraq because I don’t think you can make a fake movie by going to Marrakech or Death Valley and putting guys in desert commando outfits and having them shoot at extras with special-effects helicopters flying around and have that be more insightful than what I can get off of YouTube by typing in “combat footage from Iraq.” Charlie Wilson’s War is about something happening in 1980. I’m going to lay claim to the fact that we actually have some distance and perspective now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN Also, this is really a great story about these characters whose liabilities are their greatest assets, if that makes any sense.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Besides, you get to see Julia in a bikini and Tom’s naked bottom.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Listen, that’s worth the price of admission, to see Tom’s tochis.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Look, it’s very basic. The girls had to be naked. It’s not fair that I don’t have to be naked, you know? Come on! Turnabout is fair play.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Well, one of the girls has her shoes on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Oh, yeah. That’s one of the rules of cinema. It goes along with anybody who’s coming back from the grocery store has to have straws of celery pointing out of the bag. Any hot chick getting into a hot tub must be wearing some stiletto heels. It’s just good art direction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Julia, I went to lunch with an Oscar lobbyist …</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Can you believe that there’s such a thing as an Oscar lobbyist?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">… and he said that this was the first of your matron roles.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Julia is overjoyed to hear that!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS The man has obviously not seen my ass. [Laughter.]</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Can you please add the adjective dowdy to the words matron role?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What he meant is, this is not you as ingenue. It’s not you as romantic lead …</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Right, but my ingenue days are well behind me, aren’t they?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN No, I still go there. [Laughter.]</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Listen, however you label it, it’s just good work for me, you know? Joanne’s so fantastic to play, and between the hair and the tits and the attitude, bring it–if that’s matronly, I loved every second of it. I don’t read that many scripts. I finish less than I care to reflect upon. I mean, it’s just s___, it’s just a big pile of steaming s___ that sits in my house and drives me crazy because it’s paper, and I don’t want to send more paper to China to be toxically recycled. It just tortures me. With this–I mean, I didn’t even come into the thing until, like, page 35 or something, and I was glued to every word. It’s amazing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Steve Martin says that in any career, the struggle is the interesting part–that when you’re successful, it’s not so interesting anymore. And you guys probably don’t know this, but you’re responsible for $9 billion worth of ticket sales among you. I think a lot of it is The Man with One Red Shoe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS No, I think that had it not been for The Man with One Red Shoe, it would have been $10 billion worth. [Laughter.]</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN See, I’m rehearsing a film right now, and I was reading through it the other day, and there’s a struggle. The struggle is right there for me. I mean, maybe the career is there, but there’s still an innate struggle to try to do this thing well. It’s like it slips out of my fingers every time I think I got it.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS When you just start out and no one knows you from Adam, nobody says to you, “What’s with the hair?” You’re just a guy, and that’s the way your hair is. Then you become famous, and people say things like [miming shoving a mike in someone’s face], “What do you mean by the hair?” That’s what happened to me on the Da Vinci film.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS People say to me, Why don’t you want to be funny anymore?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tom, your son is in show business, and Julia, your niece is. I wonder how you advise them about how it’s done.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS What advice can you possibly give? Just do good work, you know? That’s about it. Oh, and don’t talk to the press too much. I remember being told that if you did not have a good set on Johnny Carson, you were going to be set back years in your career.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS I couldn’t get on Carson.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN You what?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS You had to audition to go on Johnny Carson, and I didn’t get on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN That’s ridiculous.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS But the truth is, look, there’s only 24 hours in the day. And if you’re not doing work that is good enough to make people want to set aside YouTube, set aside the stuff that they’ve TiVoed, set aside the stuff that’s coming in from Netflix, set aside anything that is going on, if you’re not doing good enough work to make people think, Oh, there’s this movie that I want to see, then you’re done. We sleep for eight hours a day; we work for eight hours a day. You have about four hours to entertain yourselves. You have to do something that’s going to be interesting enough for someone to say, I’m going to spend my four hours a day watching this movie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS I just want to sign up for that eight hours of sleep. Where do I get on that bus?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tom, are you doing Da Vinci 2?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Oh, yeah, let’s call it that! [Laughter.] But I got other stuff first. I got a John Adams movie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And Julia?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Got a little project with Clive Owen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Clive Owen–I hear he’s your main boy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HOFFMAN That’s what I heard too. Whatever.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS She’s got everybody on a little string. She’s a puppet mistress is what she is.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS Tony Gilroy is writing it and directing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">HANKS Can we be in it?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ROBERTS I’ll make a couple of calls, and I’ll text you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9tcWthan9wvsSmmKShnpx6qbXSraarsV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./0-16641-19250907-00-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TIME Magazine Cover: Joseph Caillaux - Sep. 7, 1925 - World War I</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./le-social-toujours-en-quete-de-financements.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Le social toujours en qute de financements</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

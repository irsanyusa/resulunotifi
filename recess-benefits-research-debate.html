In recent years, more parents have begun fighting a trend of reduced recess time and are calling on schools to<a href=#> give children a chance to play</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year, Rhode Island <a href=# rel=noopener>enacted a similar law</a> requiring 20 minutes of consecutive recess for elementary-school kids. The Board of Education in Atlanta, where recess was <a href=# rel=noopener>once eliminated</a>, is now <a href=# rel=noopener>considering a rule</a> that would prohibit teachers from withholding recess from students for disciplinary purposes, months after state lawmakers <a href=# rel=noopener>failed to pass</a> a bill that would have mandated 30 minutes of daily recess in schools across the state, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. And in Arizona, a <a href=# rel=noopener>bill</a> that aimed to expand recess time to 50 minutes passed in the House but met opposition in the Senate this year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Florida’s law was the culmination of a long campaign by parents in the state. One of those parents, Angela Browning, founder of <a href=# rel=noopener>Recess for All Florida Students,</a> said her kids started coming home from school in tears a few years ago, complaining that the day had been too long and that they’d had no time to play with friends. At the time, they were getting 10 minutes of recess twice a week, she said. This year, with 20 minutes of recess each day, their response has been different.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I cannot even begin to explain to you how much adding recess back into their day— how much of an effect that had on my kids,” she said. “When we have these young children and we can’t find time to give them a 20-minute break a day, we’ve lost our way.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not everyone agrees. Last year, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie <a href=# rel=noopener>vetoed a similar bill</a> that would have required 20 minutes of daily recess for students across the state. “That was a stupid bill and I vetoed it,” he said at the time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what you need to know:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The debate over recess</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the past 20 years, an increased emphasis on <a href=# rel=noopener>standardized testing</a> as a metric for student achievement has led leaders in some states and school districts to cut into recess in favor of more in-class instruction. In 2007, the Center on Education Policy at George Washington University <a href=# rel=noopener>found</a> that 62% of school districts had increased the amount of time spent on English language arts or math in elementary schools since 2001, while 44% of school districts had cut down on time spent on other subjects. The survey showed that 20% of school districts had reduced recess time. According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>2016 Shape of the Nation report</a>, just 16% of states require elementary schools to provide daily recess.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The debate over standardized testing grew with the enactment of No Child Left Behind in 2002 and, more recently, with the adoption of Common Core State Standards. Students today take an average of 112 mandated standardized tests between pre-kindergarten and 12th grade, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>an analysis</a> by the Council of the Great City Schools in 2015.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many health and education experts argue that recess is a necessary activity for child development, and parents have begun to advocate for more recess time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Some devalue recess because they assume it to be — as they assume play in young children to be — a waste of time, time that could be otherwise more efficiently spent,” Anthony Pellegrini, former professor of educational psychology at the University of Minnesota, <a href=# rel=noopener>wrote in a 2008 paper</a>. “There is no theory or empirical evidence to support this point of view. The counter-argument, that recess is good, is backed by a large body of theory and empirical research.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What the research says</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children participate in 60 minutes of “moderate to vigorous activity per day,” and suggested that recess be part of that. “Recess is a necessary break in the day for optimizing a child’s social, emotional, physical, and cognitive development,” the AAP wrote in a <a href=# rel=noopener>2013 policy statement</a>. “In essence, recess should be considered a child’s personal time, and it should not be withheld for academic or punitive reasons.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Experts argue that physical education and recess should both be part of a child’s schedule. In 2001, the Council on Physical Education for Children and the National Association for Sport and Physical Education <a href=# rel=noopener>recommended</a> that physical education classes not become a replacement for the unstructured playtime of recess.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Quality physical education along with daily recess are necessary components of the school curriculum that enable students to develop physical competence, health-related fitness, self responsibility, and enjoyment of physical activity so that they can be physically active for a lifetime,” the groups wrote in a <a href=# rel=noopener>position paper</a> about elementary school recess in 2001.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A <a href=# rel=noopener>2009 study found</a> that 8- and 9-year-old children who had at least one daily recess period of more than 15 minutes had better classroom behavior. The study also found that black students and students from low-income families were more likely to be given no recess or minimal recess. That report reinforced the <a href=# rel=noopener>results of a 1998 study</a>, which found that when 43 fourth-grade students were given recess, they worked more or fidgeted less than when they were not given recess.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When recess is eliminated or reduced, it is often because a school is allocating more time to subjects covered on standardized tests, aiming to improve student achievement. But a <a href=# rel=noopener>2010 report</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found positive associations between recess and academic performance. “There is substantial evidence that physical activity can help improve academic achievement, including grades and standardized test scores,” the report said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Another study</a>, from 2016, found that young boys who spent more time sitting and less time playing didn’t progress as quickly in reading and math.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Studies also show that recess can improve student nutrition when held before lunchtime. A <a href=# rel=noopener>2014 study</a> published in <i>Preventive Medicine</i> found that holding recess before lunch increased students’ fruit and vegetable consumption by 54%.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWhnfXd9jqucnJ2jqHqjsc2enaKso2K%2Fpr%2FEmqmcoF2ZsqOt055m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./garantie-de-letat-dexia-le-parlement-instaure-des-contreparties.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>le Parlement instaure des &amp;quot;contreparties&amp;quot;</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hurricane-names-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hurricanes Irma and Harvey: What to Know About Storm Names</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

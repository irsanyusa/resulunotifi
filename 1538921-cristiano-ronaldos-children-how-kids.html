He has won five Ballon d’Or awards and multiple league titles. He is the only player to score in five FIFA World Cup tournaments. The player has never been married, but he is a proud father of five.</p><h2>Who are Cristiano Ronaldo’s children?</h2><p class=align-left>The footballer has five children as of 2023. His youngest child, unfortunately, died at birth, leaving him with five children. Here are Cristiano Ronaldo’s kids:</p><h3>1. Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ef066879f0c4149f.jpg><p class=align-left>Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., also known as Cristianinho, is Cristiano Ronaldo’s son and the footballer’s oldest child. He was born on 17 June 2010 in the United States. His father raised him independently in the early years of the boy’s life. The player announced the birth of his son in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook post</a> in June 2010.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0b9aacd7970a2415.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>King Charles includes 'forgotten' son Prince Harry in his Father's Day celebrations despite feud</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. often accompanies his father to various football events. He has also shown an interest in playing the sport and is mentored by his father. Ronaldo Jr. is <a href=#>a footballer</a> and plays for Mahd Academy, which he joined when his father moved to Saudi Arabia to join Al Nassr. He has a strict upbringing; he is not allowed to have a cell phone and eat fast foods.</p><h4>Who is Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.’s mother?</h4><p class=align-left>The child’s mother’s identity is unknown, as Ronaldo refused to reveal it to the public. In his social media announcement, he said the baby’s mother preferred her identity to remain confidential and that he had sole custody. At the time of his birth, Ronaldo was dating <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/biographies/1519108-kristi-krimes-biography-age-real-net-worth-xo-team/ href=#>Russian model</a> Irina Shayk, but she is not his mother.</p><p class=align-left>The footballer’s reluctance to reveal his child’s mother’s identity has left fans with much speculation. One <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">version suggests</a> that the child’s mother was a surrogate for Ronaldo. However, another <a id=https://www.sportsmanor.com/soccer-who-is-the-mother-of-cristiano-ronaldo-jr/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">popular theory</a> states that she was an American waitress he had a one-night stand with. Regardless, Ronaldo insists that he will only tell the boy his mother’s identity when the time is right.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0a93a15d04261b8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many kids does Walker Hayes have?

Mateo Ronaldo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0b9aacd7970a2415.jpg><p class=align-left>Mateo is the player’s second son. He was born on 8 June 2017, alongside his twin sister Eva Maria. Mateo celebrated his sixth <a href=#>birthday</a> with a football-themed cake. He was pictured in a Barcelona jersey in May 2023, which was ironic as the club has been his fierce rival for years as he played for Real Madrid.</p><h3>3. Eva Maria dos Santos</h3><p class=align-left>Eva Maria is Cristiano’s eldest daughter and Mateo’s twin sister, born on 8 June 2017. For her sixth birthday, her cake was mermaid-themed. The footballer could not attend the birth of his twins as he had a match. He was also in the middle of a tax evasion case in Spain when the twins were born, for which he was fined $21 million.</p><h4>Who is Eva and Mateo Ronaldo’s mother?</h4><p class=align-left>The twins were born via a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">surrogate near San Diego</a>, California. However, like with his first child’s mother, the identity of Cristiano Ronaldo’s surrogate is yet to be revealed. Even so, Georgina is the twins’ stepmother and raises them with the footballer. The couple had been together for only a few months before the twins were born.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f430eb41ba4cc848.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ron White’s wife: who are the women in the comedian’s life?</span></p></a><h3>4. Alana Martina Ronaldo</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0a93a15d04261b8.png><p class=align-left>Alana Martina is the footballer’s first biological child with his long-term partner, <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/biographies/1492650-nona-sobos-biography-age-height-ethnicity-filmography/ href=#>Spanish model</a> Georgina Rodriguez. She was born in Madrid, Spain, on 12 November 2017, reportedly nine days before her official due date. She is already a potential <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/biographies/1528349-who-victoria-paris-a-influencers-personal-life/ href=#>fashion influencer</a>, spotting high-end fashion in a photo posted by kids’ fashion store Duzama, showcasing their collection.</p><h3>5. Bella Esmeralda dos Santos</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bd63e2b03bbb12f9.jpg><p class=align-left>Bella is Cristiano’s youngest daughter as of 2023. She was born on 18 April 2022 and is the player’s second child with Rodriguez. Bella was a twin, but unfortunately, she was the only survivor. Her twin brother, <a href=#>Angel</a>, died during birth. As Cristiano announced the passing of his son, he said only Bella’s survival gave him joy and strength.</p><h3>6. Angel dos Santos Aveiro</h3><p class=align-left>Angel was Cristiano’s sixth child and his third child with Rodriguez. Unfortunately, Angel died during birth, which Cristiano announced via Instagram. In an interview, he said he was emotionally conflicted as the day made him happy and sad. He also revealed that it took a week after bringing Georgina home before they told the other children about Angel’s passing.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a38af7ee9aec80c9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Antonio Brown have a wife?

However, the player never officially adopted Martunis as his son.</p><p class=align-left>Martunis Sarbini is an Indonesian <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/biographies/1488926-nicky-champas-biography-age-boyfriend-nationality-net-worth/ href=#>actor and YouTuber</a>, and former footballer. He rose to fame when he survived the 2004 tsunami that hit Indonesia, killing 230 thousand people. He was playing football with his friends when the tsunami hit, killing his mother and sister. He survived by holding onto a sofa. His father also survived, and the two were reunited later.</p><p class=align-left>Following the tsunami, journalists found Martunis stranded on the beach, where he had survived alone for 21 days. He was wearing a Portugal national team shirt and was in such poor condition because of dehydration that he urgently needed a saline drip.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e199526c62f66872.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Drake’s girlfriend timeline: who has he dated over the years?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Martunis’ story so moved Cristiano that he flew to Aceh to meet the 7-year-old boy. Although he was only 20 then, Cristiano committed to paying for Martunis’ education and helped rebuild the boy’s home. Cristiano also travelled to meet the boy frequently throughout his childhood.</p><p class=align-left>Sarbini, who had always been interested in the sport, was shortly recruited by Sporting CP Youth Academy. He joined the team’s U19 squad. Unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury in 2016, ending his football career before it took off. He later tried to become a police officer, but it did not work out.</p><p class=align-left>Currently, Martunis is an actor. He also has a <a href=#>YouTube</a> channel on which he posts mainly football-related content. Although the adoption was never official, the actor considers Cristiano his adoptive father and goes by Martunis Ronaldo <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on Facebook</a> and Instagram.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><li>How many kids does Ronaldo have?

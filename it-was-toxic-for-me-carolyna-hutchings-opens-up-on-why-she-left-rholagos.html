And it wasn't really showcasing a lot of the women in a positive light. It was more a less ‘come sit down, abuse each other, call each other ridiculous names.’”</p><p>Still speaking on toxicity on the show she added that, “The truth is if you bring drama I give it back to you. And one of the reasons people liked me was because I stood up for myself. You can't keep bullying people thinking you’re perfect when you also have scales in your eyes.”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>She clarified that she didn’t go to the show for the money. Though the housewives were not paid a salary for appearing on the show, they received an honorarium.</p><p>“I was excited. It wasn't really about the money. It was about adding value to another woman’s life,” she said.</p><p>“When I got on the show, it was a different ballgame. It was about talking about my ex-husband who did not sign a contract with me. He has no business with the show. And they are talking about my innocent children,” she said.</p><p>Hutchings said that things went sour for her on the show from the second episode.</p><p>“Right from the second episode (talking about my daughter), I was done with the show. I really wanted to leave from that moment. But because I had signed a contract I had to abide by it,” she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“I wish them all the best. It’s not for me,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6mpq%2Bhlah8qsCMsJisZaSkxaqvjJ%2Bmq2WdmnqkrdGoo7KmkWK1tsDCoaCnn6NivLGxzaxkrqhdpLtuw8eyZKyglWK5prLTZqmhp5yWtLC%2Fjpuup2yXZ8A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./le-surendettement-recule-de-59-en-2015-grace-lencadrement-du-credit-la-consommation.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Le surendettement a recul de 5,9% en 2015, grce l'encadrement du crdit la consommation</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1411031-ghanaian-journalist-danielle-kwateng-named-executive-editor-teen-vogue-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ghanaian Journalist Danielle Kwateng Named Executive Editor for Teen Vogue</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

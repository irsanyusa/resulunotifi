Even the children—five of them, 14 down to four—prefer it to the tripe generally offered. I don’t really know if they’re learning anything, but they enjoy her breathless manner of speaking, are fascinated by the way she tosses around whole fish and cuts of meat, and are rather glad they don’t have to do dishes after she cooks: “All those pots!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">MRS.

Nevertheless, I watch Julia Child’s program every week, and then the following day, I run out and buy wire whisks, watercress, souffle pans and carbon-steel knives. I have also acquired a modest but impressive assortment of wines and exotic spices. Of course, I have never used any of these things. And I certainly would never have the courage to try one of her recipes.

He is finally realizing that Great Society programs rest on his back.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Democrats have abrogated their right to speak for the taxpayer.

Only a part of wasted material is recoverable. The air we breathe is being polluted by fumes from automobiles and factories. Our rivers, lakes and ocean fronts are being destroyed by pouring into them human and factory wastes. One of the worst polluters is the paper industry. How can we return to the soil the chemically treated wood waste now going into our rivers and on to the sea?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The problem of jobs for the unskilled rightly worries us, but there must be a better way to handle the question than to advocate unlimited waste.

Hundreds of brainy M.I.T., Caltech and other technological grads are recruited each year only to be mothballed in the employer-contractors’ private skill banks, as elements in “capabilities” to be asserted in possible or problematical future competitions for new public business. Meanwhile, the eager, brilliant young men gradually sink into time-serving desuetude, their skills and motivation deteriorating, their lavish salaries charged to taxpayer-supported projects of questionable usefulness in which they play no real part.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is tragic waste indeed!</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ALFRED CONNOR BOWMAN</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hermosa Beach, Calif.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sir: You condone waste of still-usable automobiles and refrigerators because Americans can afford the “better” things, and you state that the only real waste is the waste of human resources. Did it not occur to the writer that the majority of Americans spend their lives in jobs they don’t like mainly to earn more money to buy—and to waste—such items?

For instance, birth control should not be used outside of marriage or to completely prevent parenthood. The use of birth control to produce a family that you are psychologically and economically able to have, can only be termed wise and not “sinful.” With modern science the world has progressed in many ways.

Since these Pontiffs have clearly warned us on this point, those “Catholics” who would seize this opportunity to form a “doubtful” conscience on this matter might well examine their consciences closely and see if what they are really doing is trying to justify their own transgressions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">PAUL J.

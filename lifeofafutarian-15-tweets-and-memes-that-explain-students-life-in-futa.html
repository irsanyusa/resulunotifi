You might not know much about this university, but #Lifeofafutarian tells us some funny things about the students and lecturers of the school.</p><p>1. When there is mass carryover in a course</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You know students react to carryovers differently and this happens in all schools, but when mass carryovers become a tradition, you'll only see some students laughing it off.</p><p>2. And when a student give testimony in church because he passed an exam</p><p>Going to church to give testimony after passing the test or exam you were literally expecting a carryover is popular culture among FUTA students. That's why the testimony is done with so much energy.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>3. How some lecturers like to surprise their students.</p><p>Missing a test could get you frustrated. This is FUTA, when your fellow students say a lecturer is not coming to conduct test again, don't believe them wait till you are certain the lecturer is not coming again.</p><p>4. There is a certain Prof Alese no student can mess with</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>We get to know about one certain Prof Alese, you can't just mess around him. Prof Alese from the tweets must be a no non-sense lecturer. Do you know Prof Alese?</p><p>5. The plight of students who forget to bring their ID card to exam hall</p><p>The moment this happens to a student, carryover is already staring at such student because no matter how good you are at pleading, if you don't have your ID card, <a href=# id=dc5e0dde-bc7a-5ef4-9185-d8e6cda8d645>there is no exam for you.</a></p><p>6 And how FUTA students get bombarded with handouts before exam</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When you have too many handouts to read for a course, and you hear of another set of handouts to read for the same course few minutes to exam. That is life in FUTA for you.</p><p>7. When your exam effort and the result do not look alike</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And after going through night classes, study groups, tutorials and cram sessions to make sure you pass, the exam result came out and it looks like you've only gathered EFCC.</p><p>8. Students election campaign also have slogans and reactions</p><p>The popular slogan in FUTA among student-politician is THIS IS THE VOICE OF YOUR BOY....but hey, not every student is interested in this line again campus politicians.</p><p>9. The life saving foods in FUTA featured in the #Lifeofafutarian</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>So, FUTA has a bakery and sachet water factory, now you should know that FUTA is more than a university of technology.</p><p>10. Students off campus and the Nigeria electricity issue</p><p>Away from the campus, students living off campus are not enjoying consistent power supply like those on campus and this is understandable because this is Nigeria.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>11. How student commits their exam in the hand of the Lord</p><p>Yea, exam is coming and everyone just have to go to the Lord to ask for better understanding and assimilation to pass the exam. It's a spiritual something.</p><p>12. How a difficult exam could make you confess your sin</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This is FUTA don't forget and your exam is like a trial. When you see some exam questions, you'll think God is angry at you or trying to punish you for some sins you can't remember.</p><p>13. Something about FUTA boys</p><p>To tell you how cordial the relationship between FUTA guys and starch is, someone said some students also starch their boxers (underpant) Ask a FUTA guy.</p><p>14. How the student of the university address themselves.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>You know, it is university of technology and it is expected to produce engineering graduates. So, at FUTA every student sees him/herself as an engineer.</p><p>15. You can't but feel like this after graduation</p><p>After going through the endless academic rigour designed to shape your future in the university, you can't but feel so happy after graduation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksLC5zK6loqyZmsBwv9Oum56mpGS5qrLEqJ2anqWprrO1wKdkam1dqcSmsdOsZJqmlGK6prnErGStoJGpeqbEz6WYoqZdqMG2sMSnq6xlnJ6zpnnIp2SfraSWfK2CxLKxa6U%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./barbie-hell-no.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Advocacy Group is Saying 'Hell No' to 'Hello Barbie'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1342821-who-dobre-brothers-ages-girlfriends-net-worth-house-cars-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who are the Dobre brothers: net worth, age, girlfriends, house, cars</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

His 15-year-old daughter is&nbsp;pregnant. And while many people might consider this a&nbsp;huge problem for their families, the man is&nbsp;not so&nbsp;much concerned about the <a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> itself. He’s worried that now he’ll have to&nbsp;reveal a&nbsp;family secret to&nbsp;his daughter, which has been kept from her all her life, and he’s just desperate about how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;order not to&nbsp;do&nbsp;her any harm.</p><p><h2>The man started his post with a&nbsp;shocking family fact from the past.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0d/1ff/dbdf7e5e4b849a9c52abe13771.jpg><p>A&nbsp;53-year-old dad turned to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;ask people for a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;advice in&nbsp;his tough family situation. He&nbsp;started his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, saying that he&nbsp;and his wife Rose, 53, had their older daughter Sarah, 31, when they were 22.</p><p>He&nbsp;explained how it&nbsp;all was for them, saying, «We&nbsp;were young and broke, but managed, and now we&nbsp;raised Sarah the best we&nbsp;could. She got pregnant at&nbsp;15. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very depressing time for her, she had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;therapy, and never told&nbsp;us anything about the father, which always upset her, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;never pushed the issue.»</p><p>The man goes on&nbsp;with his story, saying, that Sarah was very upset about her pregnancy. He&nbsp;says, «She originally wanted to&nbsp;terminate, but kept canceling, and eventually told&nbsp;us she wanted to&nbsp;give her up&nbsp;for adoption. But five months into the pregnancy, when she was discussing with a&nbsp;social worker for a&nbsp;couple to&nbsp;adopt, the couple dropped out of&nbsp;the adoption.»</p><p><h2>The story took a&nbsp;very whimsical turn some time after.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/077/865/9365d4577faed1518ffae66218.jpg><p>The man continues his post, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, «After trying to&nbsp;find more couples, Sarah asked&nbsp;us if&nbsp;we&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;adopt. Rose and&nbsp;I were both 38&nbsp;at this point, and we&nbsp;had both been discussing having another child, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;adopting our daughter Ellie when Sarah had her at&nbsp;16.»</p><p>Their family kept growing even more. The man wrote, «Two years after Ellie, my&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I had our son Logan (13) biologically. Growing&nbsp;up, we&nbsp;always planned on&nbsp;telling Ellie she was adopted, but we&nbsp;knew with telling her that, we&nbsp;had to&nbsp;tell her Sarah was her bio mother.»</p><p><h2>The relationship in&nbsp;the family was developing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;quite dramatic way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4e/127/2c2cff52fb9dbacfc18533db87.jpg><p>But the <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> in&nbsp;the family was not an&nbsp;ordinary one. The man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, «Sarah never became close with Ellie, not even as&nbsp;sisters. She moved out after the birth and lived with Rose’s sister. She has always shown her sisterly love to&nbsp;Logan, but never towards Ellie.<br>There has always been conflicting feelings with Sarah I&nbsp;have seen posts on&nbsp;Sarah’s Instagram where she posted a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;what was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the five of&nbsp;us, but Ellie was cut out. I&nbsp;confronted her about this, and she says it’s too painful.<br>However, a&nbsp;couple years ago she showed up&nbsp;not very sober, begging&nbsp;us to&nbsp;let&nbsp;us see her ’daughter’. We&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;her and let her stay, but did not let her near Ellie since she was not in&nbsp;the proper condition. We&nbsp;found out from her husband she had suffered several miscarriages and was told to&nbsp;consider a&nbsp;surrogate.»</p><p>The man continues, saying, «She ended up&nbsp;doing that four years ago and has since had twins Jack and Jill (3M&nbsp;and&nbsp;F) who are biologically hers. Ellie has loved being an&nbsp;aunt to&nbsp;the twins and Sarah has encouraged this with Ellie, and has been inviting Ellie over her house for family time with Logan, who loves being an&nbsp;uncle. We&nbsp;have asked Sarah that in&nbsp;light of&nbsp;the twins, and Ellie being close to&nbsp;them, wouldn’t it&nbsp;be&nbsp;time to&nbsp;tell Ellie the truth, but Sarah keeps claiming she is&nbsp;not ready.»</p><p><h2>Now the parents need to&nbsp;tell the truth to&nbsp;their daughter, at&nbsp;any cost.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31a/6d4/163476591c988ae9b4357b23de.jpg><p>Now the family is&nbsp;facing a&nbsp;huge dilemma.</p><p>The man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Recently, Ellie came to&nbsp;us and has told&nbsp;us she is&nbsp;pregnant. This time it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;completely different situation, we&nbsp;have met the father, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;childhood friend of&nbsp;hers. We&nbsp;had the talk with Ellie long ago, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;did with Sarah. We&nbsp;approached the situation calmly and have since met with the father and his parents.<br>Ellie is&nbsp;insistent on&nbsp;keeping the baby. She is&nbsp;3&nbsp;months along. We&nbsp;have not told Sarah yet, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;not know how to&nbsp;approach the situation, we&nbsp;don’t know how she will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;take&nbsp;it. My&nbsp;wife and&nbsp;I are considering telling Ellie the truth, but we&nbsp;need Sarah to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there.»</p><p><h2>People of&nbsp;Reddit expressed their opinions, and supported the desperate man.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f6/8f6/f924e75e359117e9b584e0fba5.jpg><p>Reddit users were quite supportive of&nbsp;the dad, and gave him really good advice.</p><p>One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «She won’t <i>necessarily</i> get a&nbsp;DNA test. My&nbsp;dad’s 60&nbsp;and still probably has half-siblings he&nbsp;doesn’t know about because they haven’t taken DNA tests. He&nbsp;just discovered his fifth half-sibling a&nbsp;few months ago. I&nbsp;myself have five half-siblings and one of&nbsp;them has never taken a&nbsp;DNA test, I&nbsp;only found out he&nbsp;existed because my&nbsp;mom asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad had told me&nbsp;about him.<br>I&nbsp;think it&nbsp;will probably still come out eventually, though, whether it&nbsp;be&nbsp;by&nbsp;DNA testing or&nbsp;otherwise. Better to&nbsp;tell Ellie alongside OP’s side of&nbsp;the story than have her find out later and probably feel betrayed because her adoptive parents knew all along and didn’t tell her.<br>She’ll probably be&nbsp;angry for a&nbsp;while, but&nbsp;I think when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;how she might interpret&nbsp;OP not telling her, it’s better to&nbsp;have ’We didn’t tell you because we&nbsp;didn’t want you to&nbsp;feel like your biological mother never loved you, and we&nbsp;hope that now that she’s reconnected with you somewhat, you can take this information and still know that all your family really does love you’ as&nbsp;the assumed reason than ’That was the case way back when, but after that we&nbsp;just put off telling you because ???’»</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, «As&nbsp;a&nbsp;teen mom, I&nbsp;talked endlessly about being safe. ENDLESSLY. When I&nbsp;got remarried and had another child, my&nbsp;oldest was&nbsp;IN the delivery room. None of&nbsp;them repeated my&nbsp;choices (we&nbsp;never say mistakes because they are not mistakes). Sir, y’all need to&nbsp;have serious talks about being safe, getting them birth control, and now planning how to&nbsp;support your daughter. Because you are the common denominator in&nbsp;this situation.»</p><p>And another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «Sarah is&nbsp;irrelevant here. You are acting like you’re just looking after Ellie until Sarah wanted her back. You are Ellie’s parents. You’ve raised her and you both need to&nbsp;sit down with Ellie’s and ask what her plans are with school, raising the baby, finances for the baby.<br>You really need to&nbsp;step up&nbsp;here cos you’ve dropped the ball twice now.»</p><p>And here’s yet another family story, that’s twisted so&nbsp;much that it&nbsp;resembles a&nbsp;<a href=#>detective movie</a>.

So we gathered their best quotes and introduced them into wonderful examination wishes that not only wish you a fortune but also explain how luck possibly works.</p><h2>What are the best exam success messages?</h2><p class=align-left>One may read the following quotes to reach calmness before a test or send them as exam success SMS to friends or beloved.</p><ul><li>Michael Korda once said: “Luck can often mean simply taking advantage of a situation at the right moment. It is possible to make your luck by being always prepared.” So do not worry. You are prepared, and your luck is in your hands!</li><li>John Dewey told the right thing: “Luck, bad if not good, will always be with us. But it has a way of favoring the intelligent and showing its back to the stupid.” So you have nothing to worry about. Luck will be with you!</li><li>It is Mark Warner’s phrase: “My success was due to good luck, hard work, and support and advice from friends and mentors. But most importantly, it depended on me to keep trying after I had failed.” Think about it. And even if something goes wrong during your test, do not give up. Keep on trying, and you will get what you want and deserve!</li><li>Meg Rosoff once claimed: “Every day a piano does not fall on my head is good luck.” As you can see, life is also an exam where something or someone may fail. Remember that you are already lucky to live, so do not cause stress because of some minor testing, you will get through it, I am sure!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cdb349544120831.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>150+ stupid jokes and puns that will make your day brighter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>READ ALSO: Best exams wishes for girlfriend</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1cdb349544120831.jpg><ul><li>“Luck is not chance; it is toil. Fortune is expensive smile is earned.” – Emily Dickinson claimed. I know that you worked hard and deserve the highest score. So now it is time to do and get it. Good luck!</li><li>For Michel Foucault “Chance does not speak essentially through words nor can it be seen in their convolution. It is the eruption of language, its sudden appearance. It is not a night twinkle with stars, an illuminated sleep, nor a drowsy vigil. It is the very edge of consciousness.” So do not look for luck, do not hope for better luck, but just go for it, concentrate and take an exam, the chance will go with you!</li><li>Douglas William Jerrold’s words: “Some people are so fond of bad luck they run half way to meet it.” Do not be one of them. I wish you a benevolent atmosphere in the class, but the rest depends on you. And you will succeed, I have no doubts about it.</li><li>Jean Cocteau joked: "I believe in luck: how else can you explain the success of those you dislike?" So luck exists! I believe in your powers and knowledge, and also believe that you will succeed.</li><li>Thomas Jefferson claimed: "I'm a greater believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.” You worked hard enough, so nothing but exceptional success is waiting for you ahead.</li><li>Brian Tracy noticed: “I've found that luck is quite predictable. If you want more luck, take more chances. Be more active. Show up more often.” So do not worry, because worries influence your thinking. Relax and do not keep silence when you are asked. Show yourself from the best side, and the luck will be with you.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/91b0e23fa6fe555a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 50 hurt quotes that you can learn from today</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a6157b0eacdc393c.jpeg><ul><li>Mark Twain once said: “Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident.” Never lose your hope for success because all the best things happen accidentally. Good luck with your test!</li><li>James Vila Blake said: “Luck, good or bad, is the invisible play of mind upon affairs, the effect of mental aptitudes and habits which are not in sight, but which work and bring forth their due issues.” Stop worrying and think about good things, tune on success and let luck be with you!</li><li>There are right words by Robertson Davies: “What we call luck is the inner man externalized. We make things happen to us.” I hope that you will demonstrate yourself from the best side during your finals. All is in your hands. Good luck!</li><li>“Don’t say you don’t have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur, Michelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein.” – H. Jackson Brown Jr. So, no excuses my, friend. You will cope with this exam for sure!</li><li>Roman poet Ovid said more than two thousand years ago: “Luck affects everything; let your hook always be cast; in the stream where you least expect it, there will be a fish.” I wish you to get a good score even if the situation seems hopeless!</li><li>Seneca`s attitude to luck was as follows: “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” You already have preparation; you will have an opportunity, so the only thing left is luck. I wish you good luck, darling!</li><li>R. E. Shay remarked: “Depend on the rabbit's foot if you will, but remember it didn't work for the rabbit.” I do not know if a rabbit`s leg works, but I know for sure that you have to succeed. I wish you a bright head and good ideas during your test!</li><li>Samuel Goldwyn said: “I think luck is the sense to recognize an opportunity and the ability to take advantage of it. The man who can smile at his breaks and grab his chances gets on.” I wish you take your chances and do not waste precious time! Revise everything, take a deep breath and get ready to get your high scores. I believe in you and hope that we will celebrate your results together!</li><li>“Do you know that luck is tenacity of purpose?” — Elbert Hubbard’s words. So I wish you to stay persistent on the way to the desired score. If you have a purpose, luck will be with you.</li><li>Edward Gibbon mentioned: “The winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators.” I wish to such an able knowledge navigator as you to have lucky winds and clear thoughts!</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7395940e4cb86754.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top Michael Jordan quotes that will motivate you</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/91b0e23fa6fe555a.jpg><ul><li>Barbara Sher said a good phrase: “The amount of good luck coming your way depends on your willingness to act.” I see that you want to act and get a good result. Therefore, I wish you a crazy amount of good luck because you deserve it in full!</li><li>You must have heard in a proverb that Better an ounce of luck than a pound of gold. So I wish you a pound of success in your examination, and later one more pound of gold at work!</li><li>Arab proverb claims that if you throw a lucky man in the sea, he will come up with a fish in his mouth. I wish you to be a particularly lucky person today and in the stormy sea called “examination” catch the biggest fish among others!</li><li>Red Blaik said: “The champion makes his own luck.” I wish you to be a champion today and may luck and calmness be with you at your examination!</li><li>“Pray for intestinal fortitude, work hard, and keep the faith.

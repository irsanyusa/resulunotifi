Her signature move? Oh, just casually zipping across the Atlantic Ocean, all alone&nbsp;— a&nbsp;feat only a&nbsp;person with nerves of&nbsp;steel could pull off. And if&nbsp;that wasn’t enough, she whipped out another first: the inaugural solo flight from tropical <a href=# title=Hawaii data-link=tag>Hawaii</a> to&nbsp;the mainland U.S.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d72/a49/608011595f8b0f8f4ed41a2381.png><p>However, one day, Amelia vanished during an&nbsp;audacious attempt to&nbsp;circle the entire globe in&nbsp;her trusty plane. Despite extensive searches, neither she nor her aircraft were ever found. Amelia’s vanishing act turned into one of&nbsp;the most enduring whodunits of&nbsp;the twentieth century. Now, let me&nbsp;tell you a&nbsp;bit more about the hero of&nbsp;our story. For starters, she came from the picturesque Kansas town of&nbsp;Atchison. But what made her truly special from a&nbsp;young age was the fact that she liked to&nbsp;break social molds. She liked to&nbsp;play <a href=# title=basketball data-link=tag>basketball</a> and tinker with cars!</p><p>In&nbsp;between her adrenaline-filled exploits, Amelia served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nurse’s aide in&nbsp;Toronto. There, she started hanging around local airfields, probably trying to&nbsp;pick up&nbsp;some flying tips from the local pilots. Returning to&nbsp;the U.S., Amelia dipped her toes in&nbsp;pre-med at&nbsp;Columbia University but traded her textbooks for a&nbsp;pilot’s jacket after a&nbsp;thrilling airplane ride with a&nbsp;veteran pilot in&nbsp;nineteen twenty. That was the hook: Amelia became irreversibly smitten with the sky.</p><p>Learning to&nbsp;fly was no&nbsp;small feat, but Amelia was up&nbsp;for the challenge. She enrolled for flying lessons soon after. To&nbsp;fund her high-flying dreams, Amelia got down to&nbsp;earth, slogging away as&nbsp;an&nbsp;administrative clerk in&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a>. After scrimping and saving, she finally bought her own set of&nbsp;wings&nbsp;— a&nbsp;bright yellow plane, which she lovingly dubbed “the Canary.” After her flight test in&nbsp;nineteen twenty-one, she managed to&nbsp;snatch her first flight exhibition, wowing the crowds in&nbsp;Pasadena, California.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/57c/be9/e7b8865acab4711613d9e995b7.png><p>When it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;setting records, Amelia was a&nbsp;master. She flew solo at&nbsp;amazing heights, a&nbsp;feat no&nbsp;woman had achieved before at&nbsp;that time. Next, she made a&nbsp;solo transatlantic flight, making landfall in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cow field in&nbsp;Northern Ireland. Despite her individual success, Amelia wasn’t one to&nbsp;hog the limelight. She actively worked to&nbsp;bring more women into aviation. For this, she co-founded an&nbsp;organization dedicated to&nbsp;the promotion of&nbsp;female pilots. Today, this group still champions women in&nbsp;aviation across forty-four countries.</p><p>By&nbsp;nineteen thirty-seven, Amelia was itching for another adventure. She planned a&nbsp;spectacular eastbound flight around the world, aiming to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first pilot to&nbsp;pull off this celestial showstopper. Taking off from Oakland, California, she aimed to&nbsp;encircle the globe like a&nbsp;hawk circling its prey. This time, she had a&nbsp;sidekick, a&nbsp;navigator named Fred Noonan [noo-nuhn]. The duo blazed a&nbsp;trail from Miami to&nbsp;South America, across the Atlantic to&nbsp;Africa, then to&nbsp;India and Southeast Asia.</p><p>But tragedy struck. Amelia and Fred never made it&nbsp;to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their refueling stops at&nbsp;Howland Island. Their last radio contact with the U.S. Coast Guard was enigmatic, to&nbsp;say the least. After US&nbsp;officials green-lit a&nbsp;massive search, the world waited. Sadly, after two weeks of&nbsp;suspense, Amelia and Fred were declared lost at&nbsp;sea. Ever since countless theories have bubbled up&nbsp;about their fate. The official verdict is&nbsp;that the pair were lost in&nbsp;the Pacific Ocean. This theory suggests they finished up&nbsp;all their fuel while searching for Howland Island and plunged into the vast ocean. Over the years, various well-equipped expeditions have tried to&nbsp;locate the wreckage near Howland, but alas, the ocean isn’t spilling the beans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/02e/94e/483e9e5a28bdc2a938dd3b84d5.png><p>There’s another intriguing theory&nbsp;— the ’Gardner Island Hypothesis.’ Some folks reckon Amelia and Fred landed on&nbsp;Gardner Island&nbsp;— now named Nikumaroro [nee-ku-ma-roh-row], in&nbsp;the Republic of&nbsp;Kiribati [kee-ruh-bas], which was a&nbsp;long distance off their course! Though search planes saw signs of&nbsp;recent activity on&nbsp;the island a&nbsp;week after Amelia’s disappearance, they found no&nbsp;trace of&nbsp;the plane.</p><p>This theory, however, strongly suggests that Amelia and Fred ended up&nbsp;as&nbsp;castaways on&nbsp;the island and eventually met their end there. Some evidence supporting this includes artifacts like a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;Plexiglas, a&nbsp;woman’s shoe, improvised tools, and a&nbsp;cosmetics jar from the era, even some suspicious bones. But despite expeditions and sniffing border collies, no&nbsp;conclusive proof has emerged.</p><p>Now, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>what do&nbsp;Godzilla-sized crabs have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with Amelia Earhart’s disappearance</u></a>? It&nbsp;turns out that these quirky creatures might possibly hold the keys to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=history data-link=tag>history</a>’s greatest unsolved mysteries! These ginormous creatures, the coconut crabs, would make you think twice before you dismiss anything as&nbsp;too large. They tip the scales at&nbsp;a&nbsp;whopping nine pounds and can stretch out to&nbsp;a&nbsp;startling three feet. To&nbsp;put it&nbsp;simply, they make your average pug look like a&nbsp;snack!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d7d/432/6779c15d7bbaf410714eed5487.png><p>This theory takes&nbsp;us back to&nbsp;that tiny island in&nbsp;the Pacific, where Amelia supposedly made a&nbsp;pit stop but left no&nbsp;trace&nbsp;— Nikumaroro. When people went looking for clues regarding the famous aviator’s disappearance, one rule was drilled into their thoughts: “Watch out for those monster crabs! Their pincers can really pack a&nbsp;punch!” By&nbsp;day, our explorers could easily steer clear of&nbsp;these hard-shelled creatures. They’d find the crabs lounging under the lush coconut palms, or&nbsp;maybe enjoying the breeze among the branches of&nbsp;the trees. Yes, you heard right. These critters are also good at&nbsp;climbing!</p><p>But when the sun sets? Well, that’s when things get crabby. Those courageous explorers quickly learned that sleeping off the ground was essential unless they fancied a&nbsp;late-night claw massage. You see, these jumbo crabs are like the leading actors in&nbsp;this theory about what happened to&nbsp;our heroine Earhart and her navigator. According to&nbsp;this hypothesis, when the aviators missed their mark at&nbsp;Howland Island, they improvised a&nbsp;landing strip on&nbsp;Nikumaroro’s reef. The plane eventually wandered off (planes do&nbsp;that sometimes, you know), leaving Earhart alone on&nbsp;the island. Well, alone except for our mighty crustacean friends.</p><p>By&nbsp;the nineteen forties, people had set up&nbsp;shop on&nbsp;the island, and a&nbsp;chap unearthed some bones. However, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;find only thirteen of&nbsp;them out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;possible two hundred and six&nbsp;— the total amount of&nbsp;bones in&nbsp;a&nbsp;human body. So, where did the rest of&nbsp;them&nbsp;go? You guessed&nbsp;it! Our “robber crabs” might have fancied a&nbsp;little midnight toy. Evidence indicates that the crabs have a&nbsp;tendency to&nbsp;clean up&nbsp;the island by&nbsp;dragging stuff back to&nbsp;their cozy burrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/570/3d7/7007195afb991c77de131a7100.png><p>Over the years, multiple experiments have been conducted to&nbsp;verify if&nbsp;these crabs have a&nbsp;peculiar hobby of&nbsp;bone collecting. In&nbsp;one such study, they introduced some bones to&nbsp;the island and kept their eyes peeled. Within a&nbsp;fortnight, the crabs had made a&nbsp;buffet out of&nbsp;it.</p><p>In&nbsp;another exciting chapter, our researchers brought dogs from the Canine Forensics Foundation to&nbsp;give the area around a&nbsp;ren tree a&nbsp;good sniff. The dogs had earlier indicated that someone had “kicked the bucket” there. Despite their best efforts, they couldn’t find any bones, but they’re still hopeful. After all, if&nbsp;history has taught&nbsp;us anything, it’s to&nbsp;never give&nbsp;up.</p><p>These theories at&nbsp;least have some science to&nbsp;back them&nbsp;up. But as&nbsp;with many famous disappearances, there are also juicy ones. Was Amelia captured by&nbsp;someone? Were she and Fred secret spies who returned to&nbsp;the U.S. under new identities? One of&nbsp;the craziest theories was neatly packaged in&nbsp;a&nbsp;book called “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Amelia Earhart Lives</u></a>.”</p><p>The author put pen to&nbsp;paper and argued that our beloved lady of&nbsp;the skies didn’t just vanish into thin air. Instead, she pulled a&nbsp;Houdini. And here’s where things get extra zesty. According to&nbsp;this book, Amelia was nabbed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;foreign government. Thankfully, US&nbsp;officials came to&nbsp;her rescue! After a&nbsp;heroic effort, they transported her into the most clandestine relocation program ever. Her new identity? She transformed into a&nbsp;mysterious suburban housewife under the name Irene Bolam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f7/9b9/28ea475143ae9f9f8283fbc045.png><p>But, as&nbsp;with all good stories, there was a&nbsp;twist! The hiccup was that Irene Bolam was already out there, living her life and probably whipping up&nbsp;a&nbsp;mean meatloaf in&nbsp;her suburban kitchen when she got wind of&nbsp;her new identity as&nbsp;a&nbsp;repackaged Amelia Earhart.</p><p>Obviously, Irene wasn’t too thrilled about this revelation. So, she lawyered up&nbsp;and took a&nbsp;stand against the claims, vigorously denying this shocking identity swap.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLSqrc2tZJyqkZfAbsDHnmSknaliwbB5wKacpaGRYrKivseaqa2rXZm2tK3PqZyaqpGjsKZ5l2ptaXBjZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hansel-gretel-3-1200545375.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hansel &amp;amp; Gretel</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./george-c-scott.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>George C.

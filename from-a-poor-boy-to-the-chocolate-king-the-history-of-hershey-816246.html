I&nbsp;have something special for you&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;golden ticket. You’re invited to&nbsp;visit the most unique Chocolate Factory in&nbsp;the world. What? You’re a&nbsp;bit scared because you don’t feel comfortable sailing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;chocolate river or&nbsp;turning into a&nbsp;giant blueberry? I&nbsp;hear ya&nbsp;— here’s an&nbsp;alternative treat.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, stay tuned until the end, we’re giving away a&nbsp;date with Veruca Salt, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;can find anybody interested....</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/86d/a43/e7bb12559fbab8753541dd63fa.png><p>Although —spoiler alert&nbsp;— Roald Dahl completely MADE UP&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his most famous stories [Charlie and the Chocolate Factory], he&nbsp;might have had some real-life inspiration for&nbsp;it. When he&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>at&nbsp;boarding school</a>, Dahl visited a&nbsp;local chocolate factory with other students. Their task was to&nbsp;taste new chocolate bars&nbsp;— now, that’s what&nbsp;I call a&nbsp;good field trip!</p><p>The curious young man was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wondering</a> how exactly they came up&nbsp;with different new sorts of&nbsp;chocolate. He&nbsp;imagined there was a&nbsp;secret inventing room where people in&nbsp;white were experimenting with some boiling pots, sugar, and other components, creating real magic.&nbsp;35&nbsp;years later, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory came out and became one of&nbsp;his most successful works.</p><p>Although Dahl never officially mentioned&nbsp;it, there was one real-life chocolate maker who could have easily served as&nbsp;an&nbsp;inspiration for the charismatic Willy Wonka. His name was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Milton Hershey</a>&nbsp;— yes, the Hershey&nbsp;— and his road to&nbsp;success wasn’t all cotton candy and marshmallows. It&nbsp;was chocolate.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>His father</a> [Henry Hershey] was a&nbsp;big dreamer who believed there would always be&nbsp;a&nbsp;new opportunity to&nbsp;succeed. Sadly, he&nbsp;didn’t manage to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;any of&nbsp;those opportunities. His wife must have grown tired of&nbsp;this, and the father separated from the family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/082/5fd/4a159258058f623e493bd09925.png><p>That’s why Milton didn’t have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;complete even a&nbsp;rural school education and became an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>apprentice</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;confectioner in&nbsp;his home state of&nbsp;Pennsylvania when he&nbsp;was 14. Once he&nbsp;finished with that, Hershey decided to&nbsp;borrow $150 from his aunt to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>start his own candy shop</a> in&nbsp;Philadelphia.</p><p>His first business failed 6&nbsp;years later, so&nbsp;Hershey moved to&nbsp;Denver, where he&nbsp;worked for a&nbsp;local confectioner and learned a&nbsp;secret that would later change his life. And&nbsp;no, he&nbsp;didn’t find out how to&nbsp;create an&nbsp;endless chocolate river, but he&nbsp;could make caramel from fresh milk. His <a href=# title=entrepreneurial data-link=tag>entrepreneurial</a> ambitions didn’t let Milton work for someone, and he&nbsp;took a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>couple more attempts</a> to&nbsp;start his own shop in&nbsp;Chicago and later in&nbsp;<a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> City.</p><p>The future chocolate king failed again, but he&nbsp;didn’t even think about giving&nbsp;up. He&nbsp;went back to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Lancaster</a>, where he&nbsp;was an&nbsp;apprentice as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager. He&nbsp;founded his own company [the Lancaster Caramel Company]. The caramel-making secret served him well, and the company was a&nbsp;huge success. But while he&nbsp;watched caramel in&nbsp;the making, Milton knew it&nbsp;wasn’t his true passion.</p><p>He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;popularize chocolate, which was an&nbsp;exotic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>delicacy</a> from <a href=# title=Switzerland data-link=tag>Switzerland</a> back then. So, Hershey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> his caramel business in&nbsp;1900 for an&nbsp;impressive $1,000,000 and purchased some new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>equipment</a>. He&nbsp;started experimenting with boiled milk, sugar, and cacao beans to&nbsp;manufacture affordable milk chocolate for mass production. By&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the year, he&nbsp;had already sold his very <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first Hershey bar</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/710/9ed/bcddf3565f92dce6579a07434a.png><p>5&nbsp;years later [1905], Hershey finished building his new factory that would become <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the largest chocolate</a> manufacturing plant in&nbsp;the world. Now, how do&nbsp;you imagine a&nbsp;business tycoon whose property was worth millions of&nbsp;dollars? Extravagant parties, golden statues, trips around the world, throwing money around like chocolate wrappers?</p><p>Speaking of&nbsp;the latter, Hershey was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>on&nbsp;the Titanic</a> on&nbsp;its fatal voyage and even made a&nbsp;deposit for the trip but canceled it&nbsp;due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;business emergency. He&nbsp;might have been so&nbsp;lucky because he&nbsp;was an&nbsp;exceptionally kind-hearted and selfless person, nothing like the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tycoon we&nbsp;just collectively created.</p><p>The Chocolate King must have remembered how hard it&nbsp;was for him when he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;drop out of&nbsp;school, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;invest a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;his money in&nbsp;the education and comfort of&nbsp;others. He&nbsp;built not just a&nbsp;successful business but a&nbsp;whole <a href=# title=community data-link=tag>community</a> around it&nbsp;with schools, parks, recreational facilities, and housing for his staff. Those lucky people even got a&nbsp;trolley system!</p><p>As&nbsp;for his personal life, Hershey met his future wife, Catherine, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>candy shop</a> in&nbsp;New York, of&nbsp;all places. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;his pre-successful business empire era, and he&nbsp;was delivering caramels. Since the couple couldn’t have their own offspring, they decided to&nbsp;open a&nbsp;school <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>for orphaned boys</a> [the Hershey Industrial School]. A&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years after his wife unexpectedly passed away, Hershey transferred a&nbsp;big share of&nbsp;his wealth to&nbsp;the trust that funded their school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/be9/31b/753cf35e0e8b5708d820f48330.png><p>Even during the years of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the Great Depression</a>, when it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;more natural to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;your own business, Milton wanted to&nbsp;support others in&nbsp;his town. He&nbsp;ordered a&nbsp;large <a href=# title=hotel data-link=tag>hotel</a>, a&nbsp;community building, and new offices for his company, creating many job opportunities at&nbsp;the construction sites. Since Hershey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believed</a> that “One is&nbsp;only happy in&nbsp;proportion as&nbsp;he&nbsp;makes others feel happy,” he&nbsp;must have left this world as&nbsp;a&nbsp;really happy person.</p><p>Another possible real-life inspiration for Willy Wonka could have been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Samuel Carey</a>. He&nbsp;produced chocolate and equipment for confectioners in&nbsp;the United States in&nbsp;the early 20th century. He&nbsp;published a&nbsp;whole catalog [Samuel Carey Chocolate Machinery] describing his factory in&nbsp;Glendale and the cool machines he&nbsp;used for work.</p><p>One of&nbsp;those was the Cocoa Bean Roaster. Unlike other similar machines used at&nbsp;that time, it&nbsp;had both rapid and slow roasting modes and steam control. The chocolate beans came out perfectly evenly roasted. Other machines described in&nbsp;the catalog also had some unique talents.</p><p>We&nbsp;can trace the history of&nbsp;chocolate back to&nbsp;around 1500 B.C.E. But back then, it&nbsp;was nothing like your favorite chocolate bar. Ancient Olmecs, who lived in&nbsp;Central and South America, used cacao to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;ceremonial drink. They passed their knowledge to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Maya</a>. It&nbsp;wasn’t something only for the wealthy. If&nbsp;you had been invited to&nbsp;any meal at&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular Mayan house, you’d most likely see a&nbsp;chocolate drink on&nbsp;the table. They’d add some chili peppers, honey, or&nbsp;water to&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/621/88e/844bdd53f097c83733ca5c23d8.png><p>No&nbsp;one knows exactly how chocolate made its way <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>to&nbsp;Europe</a>. There’s a&nbsp;version that says that Christopher Columbus himself did it&nbsp;as&nbsp;he&nbsp;found cacao beans on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mayan canoe which greeted him during his 4th voyage to&nbsp;America.</p><p>By&nbsp;the later 15th century, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;super popular drink at&nbsp;the Spanish court. Then, the rumor spread to&nbsp;other countries. The Europeans, who weren’t such huge fans of&nbsp;all things spicy, made their own version of&nbsp;ancient hot chocolate. They replaced chili peppers with cane sugar, cinnamon, and other spices and flavorings they were used&nbsp;to.</p><p>Famous French Queen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Marie Antoinette</a> loved hot chocolate so&nbsp;much that she brought her personal chocolate maker with her when she moved into the Palace at&nbsp;Versailles. She introduced a&nbsp;new official title for him [“Chocolate Maker to&nbsp;the Queen”]&nbsp;— I&nbsp;wonder if&nbsp;it&nbsp;still exists, and where do&nbsp;I send my&nbsp;CV?</p><p>He&nbsp;experimented with new recipes and added things like orange blossom or&nbsp;sweet almonds to&nbsp;the drink. If&nbsp;you really want that job, you can try melting some chocolate right now with a&nbsp;tool like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>this</a> or&nbsp;even make your own <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chocolate fountain</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0f5/e03/022c3a5562a457a162768bfa15.png><p>Let’s fast-forward a&nbsp;bit, all the way to&nbsp;modern times. Currently, the largest chocolate factory in&nbsp;the world based on&nbsp;production numbers is&nbsp;located in&nbsp;Belgium [Barry Callebaut]. They create <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1,000 tonnes</a> of&nbsp;chocolate every day and supply liquid chocolate to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>famous sweet brands</a> like Nestle, Unilever, and Hershey.</p><p>They also have separate production lines for smaller, gourmet chocolatiers. Over 900 people work for the factory, and the process doesn’t ever stop. They even have a&nbsp;small reproduction of&nbsp;a&nbsp;tropical forest where they grow their own beans. Does it&nbsp;also remind you of&nbsp;Willy Wonka’s chocolate forest, or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;just&nbsp;me?</p><p>If&nbsp;you feel like becoming a&nbsp;chocolatier yourself by&nbsp;now, they also have a&nbsp;Chocolate Academy. Now, before you book your golden ticket to&nbsp;Belgium, you can practice at&nbsp;home with this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chocolate bar maker</a> or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;chocolatier starter kit</a>&nbsp;I found on&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLOzu8xmmGaon6S%2Fbq7OsmStp12ptaZ5wqGmnKeclsGmecqipaBlpJ2ybrTIrKuoqqlivKd5x56prKCVrnp5fZVra29n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ptsd-is-not-a-joke.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>I Have PTSD, and It's Not a Joke</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./disparition-des-numeros-de-departements-la-resistance-sorganise.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Disparition des numros de dpartements : la rsistance s'organise</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

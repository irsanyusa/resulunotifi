Women <a href=#>earn 16% less</a> than men, and the gender gap in labor force participation is one of the highest in Latin America. But perhaps the most shocking statistic is that every hour, at least one woman <a href=#>disappears</a>, and every day, 11 women die <a href=#>violently</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Few would imagine that this same country has just elected a female President. Claudia Sheinbaum, former mayor of Mexico City and loyal successor to the left-wing incumbent, Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), has come out on top following the <a href=#>June 2 vote</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The question is how in the world this happened. In a county where <a href=#>90%</a> of Mexicans harbor negative biases against women, and 58% hold such biases specifically against female politicians, tens of millions have voted for women. That includes not just Sheinbaum but <a href=#>Xóchitl Gálvez</a>, a senator and businesswoman, who the opposition rallied behind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is <a href=#>no small puzzle</a>. Mexico’s negative biases against female leaders <a href=#>nearly double</a> those of the U.S. or Canada. Yet, Mexico has become the first North American nation to elect a female leader. The results are still streaming in, but Mexico is also expected to boast the fourth largest contingent of congresswomen in the world and to have women governing nearly half of its 32 states.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-2.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-3.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The empowerment of women in Mexican politics did not occur haphazardly. It stemmed from a deliberate, albeit gradual, construction of a legal framework fostering gender parity—most notably through mandatory gender quotas. It all <a href=#>started in 1996</a> when a law recommending that at least 30% of candidates should be female was passed. In 2002, a congress that was <a href=#>84% male</a> made it mandatory, but with the big exception that voters could elect men in primaries. “That was what took us to court to demand that the exception be eliminated,” Silvia Hernández, the only Mexican female that has been senator for three terms, told me about the lawsuit Mexican women launched in response. Many more women accompanied the process. In 2011, the court ruled in their favor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Things moved fast from then. Mexico went from having 26% congresswomen in 2011, to 42% in 2015, and 48% just ahead of the Sunday vote. And that is not all. The expected success of women at the governor-level is no doubt helped by Mexican electoral authorities <a href=#>mandating</a> that more than half or each party’s gubernatorial candidates be female, and that they not be fielded in areas where their party is expected to fare poorly.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yet voters wonder whether a President Sheinbaum will make things better for Mexican women. There is some hope. She has outlined a bold vision for creating a <a href=#>“national care system”</a> to establish nurseries, nursing homes, and sick care facilities to alleviate the burden of unpaid care work, which is primarily carried out by women.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, recent history has demonstrated that female leadership does not always translate into better policies for women. According to <a href=#>my own research</a>, Mexico’s women legislators consistently support federal budgets that underfund the amount of money allocated to gender equality programs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sheinbaum’s rise to power excites many women who will identify with a female leader. Yet AMLO <a href=#>did not</a> have a good relationship with the feminist organizations that criticized him. The fear is that Sheinbaum doesn’t have it either.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-4.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Concerns also linger over how Mexican voters might respond to a President Sheinbaum, especially when she inevitably makes errors, as all politicians do. Studies <a href=#>indicate</a> that female leaders often endure harsher backlash than their male counterparts, a phenomenon exacerbated in Mexico by prevailing societal sexism. Being a female President won’t be easy. A <a href=#>survey</a> by Enkoll in February found that a third of Mexicans feel “the country is not prepared” for one, and 14% openly say they would prefer a man in the job.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That sexism has and will come from women. During the campaign, opposition parties astutely dog whistled at latent Mexican sexism. In the first presidential debate, Gálvez nicknamed Sheinbaum “the ice lady,” casting her as cold and heartless—a direct affront to societal expectations that women be warm and nurturing. In another debate, Sheinbaum was criticized by Galvez on her choice of attire, implying that her “lack of religiosity” rendered her unfit for office. A famous female Mexican intellectual, Guadalupe Loaeza, also criticized her curly hair ahead of the vote, arguing it was evidence that Sheinbaum was “an envious little girl.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Outside of politics, Sheinbaum will have to contend with pundits who have frequently called her AMLO’s “clon,” “protégé,” “favorite subordinate,” “spoiled girl,” or “little flower.” These critics assume that she is being manipulated or controlled by AMLO, rather than, what is more probably happening, which is that Sheinbaum is part of a political movement that is <a href=#>broadly popular</a> and whose policies have been successful in attracting voters. It is only strategic to continue advancing this popular program.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She is also frequently accused of being arrogant due to her disciplined and sober personality, as well as her ability to dodge difficult questions from the press. “I have no doubt that in a male politician, these traits would likely be hailed as signs of professionalism and power,” Marta Lamas, a recognized feminist and professor from Mexico’s National Autonomous University, told me. In Sheinbaum’s case, they morph into liabilities, inviting accusations of haughtiness and conceit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sheinbaum is a capable politician in her own right. She <a href=#>won Morena’s primary</a> against four men and had previously won two elections. As mayor of Mexico City, she demonstrated the ability to distance herself from AMLO in areas that she deemed relevant. Unlike him, she <a href=#>wore a mask</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic, spearheaded major clean energy projects, and avoided the militarization of state police.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Polls ahead of the vote <a href=#>showed</a> that Sheinbaum’s campaign was supported by more women than men. But in a country where being a woman is so difficult, support will only last if she delivers as President. The feminist struggle to put women in power does not end with Sheinbaum’s victory. The most important challenge is translating gender equality into reality. Success won’t come easily.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWhof3WCjqmpnquZmbKvwIysn56hnpeutrmMppyxoZOkeqa4xJyroqeeZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./art-modern-gothic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Art: Modern Gothic | TIME</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1567473-skilla-babys-age-height-real-hometown-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Skilla Baby's age, height, real name, hometown, net worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

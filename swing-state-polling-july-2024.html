However, far fewer voters perceive Biden as in good health (15%) or mentally fit (23%) when compared with the Republican candidate, driven in good part by declines among Democrats.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Both findings mirror our <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>post-debate research on the wider national electorate</a>, which found that Democrats drove declines in perceptions of Biden’s mental fitness and age when comparing surveys conducted before and after the first 2024 debate.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite rather close contests in most of the swing states surveyed, the overall swing-state electorate would like to see Biden end his campaign.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Among all swing-state voters, 55% said Biden should not continue his campaign, including 29% of Democrats and 58% of independents. When these voters were asked about Trump, they were 10 percentage points less likely to say he should end his bid (45%), with fewer than 1 in 10 Republicans sharing that sentiment.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Should Biden continue his 2024 bid amid persistent concerns about his age and abilities, the debate also appears to have raised the importance of the vice presidential nominee.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">According to the latest survey, 32% of swing-state voters said the candidates’ respective ages make their running-mate “much more important” to them than it has been in prior presidential elections, up from 24% in our survey conducted in May. Among Democrats, that figure climbed 10 points (from 26% to 36%), along with a 9-point increase among independent voters (24% to 33%).</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While Trump has yet to announce his running mate, Biden’s No. 2 — Vice President Kamala Harris — is notably less disliked than the two ticket-toppers across the swing-state map.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In the aggregate, 53% of swing-state voters hold unfavorable views of Harris, compared with 56% who said the same of Biden and 55% of Trump. Harris has the largest popularity advantage over Trump in Michigan and Nevada, the latter of which is begging for improved Democratic standing should the party ultimately need to win it in November.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The bottom line</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the first 2024 presidential debate appeared to alarm some Democratic leaders and created an opening for the press to ditch its politeness about discussing Biden’s cognitive abilities, our surveys of swing-state surveys for Bloomberg News — and our national-level data — show the matter has done little to change the underlying dynamics of the contest.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While Biden is still underperforming Trump, the newfound vocal alarm from those in his party has been met by a more modest growth in concern among the electorate, suggesting the age matter was already baked into many voters’ calculus; the main difference now is voters’ renewed emphasis on each candidate’s vice presidential selections as the race moves forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6jEqrrGZqqtmaSaerG7y6Wgp59dn8KtxYxrZ2ts</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./le-gouvernement-abaisse-80-kmh-la-vitesse-sur-les-routes-secondaires.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Le gouvernement abaisse 80 km/h la vitesse sur les routes secondaires</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1438443-topher-parks-biography-deavan-cleggs-partner-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Topher Parks biography: who is Deavan Cleggs new partner?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

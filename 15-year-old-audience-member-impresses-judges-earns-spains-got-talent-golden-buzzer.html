While the fifth round of auditions has just concluded, one particular moment from the show’s recent episode stood out. In the episode, an audience shocked the judges and earned a Golden Buzzer, without even waiting in the audition line.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-young-audience-member-earns-spain-s-got-talent-golden-buzzer>Young Audience Member Earns Spain’s Got Talent Golden Buzzer</h2><p>During a brief intermission, audience members were invited to showcase their talents. Among them was a 15-year-old Naia Castro Collantes. The singer stunned everyone with her soulful rendition of Bruno Mars’ “When I Was Your Man.”</p><p>Judge Risto Mejide, often known for his stern demeanor (similar to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>), couldn’t help but enjoy the moment. He invited Naia to come over to the judges’ table, where they engaged in a brief conversation.</p><p>It turns out that Mejide had seen Naia perform years ago in a theater production of Annie with his son. Naia revealed that she had indeed been in Annie and that Mejide had recognized her potential back then, and told her that she had “the makings of an artist.”</p><p>Judge Paula Echevarría couldn’t help but inquire if Naia had come to participate in the competition or merely as an audience member. Mejide suggested bringing her up on stage, a proposal that garnered enthusiastic support from the audience.</p><p>Naia then took to the stage, and when asked what she wanted to sing, she chose “Tomorrow” from the musical Annie. Her performance was nothing short of spectacular, leaving both the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">audience</a> and her proud father in tears.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-judges-react-to-her-performance>The Judges React to Her Performance</h2><p>Judge Edurne was quick to commend Naia’s exceptional talent. She expressed her desire to see Naia in future musical productions on the grandest stages, including La Gran Vía, London, and New York.</p><p>Guest judge and comedian Florentino Fernández echoed these sentiments, calling Naia’s voice spectacular and her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">talent</a> deeply moving. It was evident that Naia had touched the hearts of all who witnessed her performance.</p><p>The moment of truth arrived when the judges cast their votes. Echevarría started with a resounding “Super Yes,” followed by another enthusiastic “Yes” from Edurne. However, when it came to Mejide, there was a surprising twist. Despite his enjoyment of Naia’s performance, he delivered a shocking “No” vote. His reasoning? He believed that Naia had taken the easy route and challenged her to step out of the musical genre.</p><p>This decision left everyone visibly upset, as Naia’s talent was undeniable. However, the guest judge, Fernández, had one more surprise up his sleeve. He gave Naia his coveted Golden Buzzer, a gesture that sent shockwaves of joy throughout the auditorium.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_PutriAriani_Steve-Granitz_FilmMagic-220x147.jpg alt="Putri Ariani Stuns With Emotional Billie Eilish Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57kG5ksp2Rp3qwuMNmmK6cmZq7pLGMppymmpWneqq5z6ucrKuVqHqrwcOgnKxllZa%2Fr7%2BMrKeaoZ6oeqi702armqSVo8Fus86lm56mXZfCu8bEq2Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./becky-nurse-of-salem-review-play-sarah-ruhl-deirdre-oconnell-1235453107.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Becky Nurse of Salem Review: Witch Trials, Trump and the Kitchen Sink in Sarah Ruhls</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./this-futuristic-airbus-smart-seat-prototype-may-make-the-future-of-economy-flying-a.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>This futuristic Airbus smart seat prototype may make the future of economy flying a bit less miserab</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

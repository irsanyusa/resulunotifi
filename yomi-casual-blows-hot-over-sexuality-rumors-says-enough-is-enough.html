Silence is golden..." they will get tired and move on to the next person." But I am the one wearing the shoes, and I am the one feeling all pains and damages to my reputation as a father, husband, and businessman."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He added that he has never nursed the idea of being gay and will never do so. He cursed himself, stating that if he ever did (nurse the idea of being gay), he should face grave consequences.</p><p>In his words, "Coming out of church today and having reflected on all the lies against me, I want to say I am not too good a Christian who would turn and take a slap on the other cheek. Enough is enough. Should I Omoniyi, Olorunyomi Makun be gay or nurse any single idea of sleeping with a fellow man, may death take me before my time, may everything that God has blessed me with be taken away from me. May I not prosper in anything I lay my hands to do. May failure become my portion in everything that concerns me till death."</p><p>Yomi also cursed the rumour mongers, saying that if the rumours were true and the act was motivated by jealousy and vile motives, they would face severe consequences.</p><p>"On the other hand, if these are fabrications borne out of envy, jealousy, wickedness, and insecurities, I pray for the same God to vindicate me. May those of you who enjoy and share such lies against me be also entertained with the pain you bring to my family. May that thing that has kept you jobless remain in your lives till death. Today, i pronounce death, doom, and destruction on anyone who would continue to incite lies designed to assassinate my character. I also pronounce the same on those who fall and fly with it without confirmation," he wrote.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He added, "May all these curses return to me if I am truly gay. Enough is enough! Note: As you come here to say "no blog mentioned your name," but some of you remembered to tag me or put in a comment with my name in their comment sessions... May you and your entire family suffer from depression and untimely death!"</p><p>She posted a lengthy statement on Instagram in which she addressed the notion that Yomi Casual was gay and berated those who made the assumption.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGayp52eeqSt0q6YpWWSoby4v4yhpq1ln6uys3nSnq%2BumZyewbp50a6kqKqjYsCixdJmnKenpZy1brXSZpynp6WctXC%2F16aisXGW</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-plays-musicals-2015.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Plays &amp;amp; Musicals 2015: 'Hamilton' and 'John'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-york-city-public-bathroom-access-expansion.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ur In Luck New Yorkers: City To Expand Bathroom Access</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

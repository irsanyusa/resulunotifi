We often see the vote share of smaller parties diminish as we approach general elections, and with Reform UK polling at around 8% in current voting intention figures, Rishi Sunak could really benefit from a chunk of that vote. New YouGov polling suggests, however, that Reform UK supporters might be tricky to win over.</p><p data-block-key=csms1>One reason supporters switch their vote in the run up to the election is that their party stands little chance of winning, but the vast majority of those saying they’ll vote Reform UK are already realistic about the party’s slim chances of winning seats. Two thirds (67%) say its unlikely the party will win in their own constituency, compared to less than one in five (18%) thinking they have a chance. In fact just 5% say the party are “very likely” to win in their seat.</p><p data-block-key=86tie>Reform UK’s leader Richard Tice has said the party will stand in every seat at the next election, however this may be very aspirational (neither the Lib Dems nor the Greens did so in 2019). When presented with a hypothetical scenario where the party doesn’t stand in their constituency at the next election, just three in ten of those who currently intend to vote Reform UK (31%) say they would vote Conservative. A similar number say they wouldn’t bother voting in this scenario (27%) while one in five (20%) say they’d vote for a different smaller party.</p><p data-block-key=93bsl>Even when looking only at Reform UK voters who backed the Conservatives in 2019, just 37% say they would vote Conservative again even if Reform UK didn’t stand.</p><p data-block-key=6bleh>With Nigel Farage agreeing that the-then Brexit Party wouldn’t stand in Conservative held seats at the last election, the party received just 2% of the overall vote share, despite polling at 10% a few months earlier. The majority (66%) of current Reform UK supporters therefore voted Conservative in 2019, but that was for a very different party than they are presented with now.</p><p data-block-key=59h1n>Firstly, the 2019 general election was all about Brexit, with the issue being by far the biggest concern for voters. With the Conservatives running their campaign on ‘getting Brexit done’, they were naturally appealing to those Leave voters who supported the Brexit Party. Brexit is now ranked the seventh most pressing issue with the public, and so will likely be a much smaller talking point at the next election.</p><p data-block-key=5uqgl>Secondly, those intending to vote Reform UK at the next election have a very different perception about the current Conservative Party and leader than those who said they would vote Brexit Party in 2019 and eventually voted Conservative. Ahead of Farage’s decision not to stand candidates in all seats in 2019, six in ten (59%) Brexit Party supporters had a favourable view of the Conservative Party, and a remarkable 84% had a favourable view of then party leader Boris Johnson. In contrast, just one in five of Reform UK voters currently have a favourable view of both the Conservatives (21%) and Rishi Sunak (21%).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGyEdoWMnKanq5Wnw6LAyK%2BcrGWlo7mqt8SlsGasn2LEqrqMqK2eql2nsqe70aZkrqNdqMKxvM6rq56qo2KutXnNnq%2BtZZWhsqTAyKil</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./international-discord.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>International: Discord | TIME</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alesha-dixon-hits-bgt-golden-buzzer-for-inspiring-group-of-performers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alesha Dixon Hits 'BGT' Golden Buzzer for Inspiring Group of Performers</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

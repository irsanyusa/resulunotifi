You’ve already figured out I’m about to&nbsp;ask you what they all have in&nbsp;common, right? The boring answer is&nbsp;they’ve all lived on&nbsp;this planet at&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain point in&nbsp;time, bla bla bla, sure. What’s even more surprising about their common features is&nbsp;their coloration!</p><p>On&nbsp;that note, let me&nbsp;tell you about <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Abbott Thayer and his amazing theories on&nbsp;animal coloration</a>! He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;portrait painter extraordinaire, but he&nbsp;also had a&nbsp;thing for the colors of&nbsp;the natural world. He&nbsp;came up&nbsp;with some pretty cool ideas about how animals can stay hidden from predators or&nbsp;prey, and they’re still relevant today!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d1f/a63/170b0e511d9240d469d22f29b2.png><p>One of&nbsp;his most famous theories is&nbsp;called countershading. Basically, animals are “painted” by&nbsp;nature so&nbsp;that the parts that get the most light from the sky are the darkest, and vice versa. It’s like they’re wearing the perfect outfit to&nbsp;match their environment!</p><p>And let me&nbsp;tell you, this technique is&nbsp;not just for fashion-savvy animals. It’s also used by&nbsp;ships to&nbsp;avoid detection. Thayer and his friend even got a&nbsp;patent for&nbsp;it! Thayer also came up&nbsp;with the idea of&nbsp;background blending, which is&nbsp;when an&nbsp;animal or&nbsp;object is&nbsp;painted to&nbsp;match the colors of&nbsp;its surroundings. Think of&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural camouflage suit.</p><p>Thayer didn’t stop there, though. He&nbsp;also proposed a&nbsp;theory on&nbsp;something called disruptive or&nbsp;dazzle camouflage. This is&nbsp;when an&nbsp;object is&nbsp;painted with a&nbsp;crazy pattern to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;judge its distance or&nbsp;speed. It’s like when you’re trying to&nbsp;hit a&nbsp;piñata that’s moving all over the place, and you can’t quite get your timing right.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/80e/9ea/71b0705d299f562e5c9582b6ef.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Think about&nbsp;it</a>, if&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;shark swimming beneath the surface of&nbsp;the ocean, and you look&nbsp;up, you’re going to&nbsp;see the bright sky and the lighter-colored ocean surface. If&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;prey animal swimming on&nbsp;the surface, your lighter belly will blend in&nbsp;with the bright sky while your darker back will blend in&nbsp;with the deeper water. It’s not just aquatic animals that use countershading to&nbsp;their advantage. Land animals like deer and rabbits have lighter bellies and darker backs, which helps them blend in&nbsp;with the dappled light of&nbsp;the forest floor.</p><p>And let’s not forget about birds! Many birds have countershading on&nbsp;their feathers, which helps them blend in&nbsp;with the sky when seen from below and the ground when seen from above. Some creatures out there have a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;warning others that they’re not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;messed with. Yeah, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>it’s called aposematism</a>&nbsp;— a&nbsp;fancy word for using bright colors or&nbsp;markings to&nbsp;let predators know that they’re toxic or&nbsp;just downright unappetizing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/93a/9a9/62ec945f4093ba23cae13e047c.png><p>Take the skunk, for example. That broad white stripe on&nbsp;its back is&nbsp;like a&nbsp;neon sign that says “Don’t get too close, or&nbsp;else you’ll regret&nbsp;it!” And those yellow-banded poison dart frogs? They’re walking billboards for their own poison, with their bright and graphic colors letting everyone know that they’re not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fooled with.</p><p>Even wasps use the power of&nbsp;bright colors to&nbsp;signal to&nbsp;potential threats that they’re packing a&nbsp;sting. And you know those cute little ladybugs? The brighter they are, the more toxic they can be&nbsp;— who knew that something so&nbsp;adorable could be&nbsp;so&nbsp;deadly?</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that white, yellow, red, and black are the most effective warning colors in&nbsp;the <a href=# title="animal kingdom" data-link=tag>animal kingdom</a>. Just like how traffic signs caution drivers, these bright markings are nature’s way of&nbsp;saying “Watch out, buddy!” If&nbsp;you ever come across a&nbsp;critter with some serious bling, just remember&nbsp;— they’re not trying to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fashionable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/495/fa2/3607d0588ba4dd0dfae4f35921.png><p>But how come <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>some animals have evolved to&nbsp;use bright colors and others did not</a>? It’s a&nbsp;question that’s been baffling scientists for a&nbsp;long time. Thankfully, one theory coming from a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;researchers at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Arizona has uncovered some interesting insights into this colorful mystery.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that the function of&nbsp;an&nbsp;animal’s vibrant coloring is&nbsp;strongly linked to&nbsp;the activity patterns of&nbsp;its evolutionary ancestors. So, species that use their bright colors to&nbsp;attract mates are usually descended from ancestors that were active during the day. Meanwhile, those that use their colors to&nbsp;ward off predators usually had ancestors that were active at&nbsp;night.</p><p>It&nbsp;seems that animals have evolved to&nbsp;use their colors in&nbsp;the most advantageous way possible! Now, you may be&nbsp;wondering how vivid coloration even came to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the first place. Well, it&nbsp;seems that early in&nbsp;their evolution, most species started out pretty plain and drab. But over time, bright colors evolved across many different lineages because they helped animals survive and reproduce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e85/2e7/10342e5df98752646c8d5bbf30.png><p>But not all bright colors are created equal. The researchers found that vividly colored lizards and birds usually use their coloring as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mating signal to&nbsp;attract partners, while colorful amphibians and snakes often wear their colors as&nbsp;a&nbsp;warning sign for predators. And get this, many of&nbsp;these amphibians and snakes are diurnal (active during the day) now, but their ancestors were actually nocturnal (active at&nbsp;night). So, there’s no&nbsp;clear connection between warning colors and present-day activity patterns.</p><p>Mother nature sure is&nbsp;creative when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;helping animals adapt and survive in&nbsp;the wild. But there are some creatures out there that could take the award for the weirdest animals any day. Have you ever stopped to&nbsp;think about what it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;like if&nbsp;we&nbsp;could see through all the layers that protect our internal organs? Because that’s exactly what has happened with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the glass frog</a>! Imagine you’re strolling through the lush rainforests of&nbsp;Central and South America, and you come across a&nbsp;tiny little frog perched on&nbsp;a&nbsp;leaf. From above, it&nbsp;looks like your average, run-of-the-mill frog. But if&nbsp;you flip it&nbsp;over, you’ll see all of&nbsp;its organs on&nbsp;display&nbsp;— heart, intestines, and all.</p><p>You might be&nbsp;wondering why on&nbsp;earth these frogs have evolved to&nbsp;be&nbsp;see-through. It&nbsp;turns out that their super thin, translucent skin actually helps them blend in&nbsp;with their surroundings, too. When light shines on&nbsp;them from above, their silhouette becomes all jumbled up&nbsp;and difficult for predators to&nbsp;decipher. And let’s face&nbsp;it, when you’re surrounded by&nbsp;vibrant greenery, a&nbsp;green topcoat is&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect camouflage! But what about those transparent legs? Well, they help to&nbsp;blur the outlines of&nbsp;the frog’s body, making it&nbsp;even tougher for predators to&nbsp;recognize their shape.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/499/312/6d95a7503f8485d283b5ddd009.png><p>I, for one, had no&nbsp;idea <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>penguins also came&nbsp;in... yellow</a>. One wildlife photographer stumbled upon a&nbsp;sight that left him gobsmacked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote island in&nbsp;the southern Atlantic Ocean. He&nbsp;captured some amazing images of&nbsp;a&nbsp;yellow king penguin that had everyone on&nbsp;the beach flapping with excitement! There were 120,000 birds on&nbsp;that beach, and this was the only yellow one there. Scientists are scratching their heads as&nbsp;to&nbsp;how this coloration happened naturally. They think it’s a&nbsp;form of&nbsp;leucism&nbsp;— which is&nbsp;basically an&nbsp;animal’s inability to&nbsp;produce the proper pigments for its natural coloration. But they’re not entirely sure.</p><p>All king penguins produce small amounts of&nbsp;this yellow pigment naturally, but in&nbsp;this particular bird, it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the only pigment the animal could produce. Talk about standing out from the crowd, am&nbsp;I&nbsp;right? There are some colors though you’ll rarely find in&nbsp;the animal kingdom. According to&nbsp;some polls, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>blue is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;— if&nbsp;not the most&nbsp;— popular colors amongst people</a>. Most animals however have a&nbsp;tough time sporting this shade. Some animals get their pigments from the food they eat, like how flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp or&nbsp;how goldfish can alter their golden hue based on&nbsp;their diet.</p><p>But unfortunately, there’s no&nbsp;true blue pigment in&nbsp;plants, so&nbsp;animals can’t turn blue through their food. Instead, they have to&nbsp;get creative! For instance, some animals make structures that change the wavelength of&nbsp;light to&nbsp;appear blue. The blue morpho butterfly is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great example of&nbsp;this. Its wing scales are shaped in&nbsp;ridges that cause light to&nbsp;bend in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;way that it&nbsp;reflects only the color blue. If&nbsp;the scales were shaped differently, the butterfly would lose its beautiful blue color.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyapaKlkaHAbsPIrZ9mmpyqsm6vzqWmq6tdlr%2BmedKup56qXaeus7GMcWhtbGltfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-you-get-the-ick-psychology.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why We Get the Ick,' According to Psychologists</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./0-16641-19470922-00-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>TIME Magazine Cover: Jackie Robinson - Sep. 22, 1947 - Baseball - Blacks - Most Popular</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

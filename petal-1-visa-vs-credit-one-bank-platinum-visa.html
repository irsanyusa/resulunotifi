Below is a side-by-side overview of both cards. Consider these and other factors when deciding whether either card is a good fit for you.</p><h3>Welcome Bonus</h3><p>Like many credit-building cards, <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> and Credit One Bank Platinum Visa do not come with a welcome bonus offer. Welcome bonuses are <a rel=alternate href=#>limited-time offers</a> for new cardholders who meet spending or other offer requirements to earn a one-time bonus, usually related to the card's rewards program structure.</p><p>Welcome bonus winner: Tie</p><h3>Rewards</h3><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> doesn't offer a traditional rewards structure that earns points or cash back for all card spending. Instead, cardholders can earn cash back with select local and regional merchants. Cash back amounts range from 2% to 10% based on the offer terms. Merchant offers are automatically loaded to your Petal account. They're also personalized and vary throughout the year, so the offers you see may be different from what’s given to another cardholder.&nbsp;</p><p>Cash back earned is loaded into your Cash Back Wallet the following billing cycle as Cash Back Points. Cash Back Points are redeemable for a statement credit, ACH transfer, or paper check by mail.</p><p>Credit One Bank Platinum Visa earns unlimited 1% cash back on eligible purchases of gas, grocery, internet, cable, satellite TV, and mobile phone service. Rewards are automatically redeemed as a statement credit equal to 1% of eligible purchases made during the billing period.</p><p>The card also earns up to 10% cash back at select merchants through the More Cash Back Rewards Program. This program runs separately from the card's primary cash back offer.</p><p>Available offers are found online at the More Program website or sent to cardholders via email. You'll automatically earn cash back if your card purchases meet the offer requirements. You earn an automatic statement credit based on the cash back earned from qualifying purchases.</p><p>Both cards' merchant cash back programs can be hit or miss depending on the offers available and your spending habits. With unlimited 1% cash back in popular spending categories, the Platinum Visa is the clear winner for earning rewards.</p><p>Rewards winner: Credit One Bank Platinum Visa</p><h3>Annual fee</h3><p>Some credit cards come with an annual fee, the yearly cost for access to the card account and benefits. Consider whether the card offers enough value through rewards, card features and perks to justify paying the additional cost.</p><p>Credit One charges a $39 annual fee on the Platinum Visa. The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> doesn't charge an annual fee. However, when you apply for preapproval through Petal, you're evaluated for multiple cards. If you don't meet the credit or other eligibility requirements for the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span>, Petal may pre approve you for the Petal 1 Rise Visa, which has a $59 annual fee.</p><p>With <a rel=alternate href=#>preapproval</a>, you can choose whether to apply, knowing in advance if you meet the basic requirements for the no-fee version.</p><p>Annual fee winner: <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span></p><h3>APR</h3><p>The annual percentage rate (APR) is the cost of borrowing money annually expressed as a percentage. The <a rel=alternate href=#>higher a card's APR</a>, the higher the interest rate charged if you carry a balance.</p><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> has a variable APR range of 24.99% to 34.49% based on your creditworthiness and other factors. The Credit One Bank Platinum Visa has a variable APR of 28.99%. Both cards feature variable APRs, which can change at any time based on the market.</p><p>With either card, you will pay a fairly high APR if you carry a monthly balance. <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> Visa gets the nod because it offers a potentially lower APR, but you'll need to meet credit requirements to earn it.</p><p>APR winner: <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span></p><h3>Foreign transaction fee</h3><p>Some credit cards charge a fee on purchases made outside of the U.S., called a foreign transaction fee. These fees could add up quickly if you're a frequent international traveler.</p><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> wins in this category because it has no foreign transaction fees. The Credit One Platinum Visa charges either $1 or 3% of each purchase in U.S. dollars, whichever is greater, on purchases made outside of the U.S.</p><p>Foreign transaction fee winner: <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span></p><h3>Other card benefits</h3><p>Typically, you need good-to-excellent credit to qualify for credit cards that offer many benefits and perks. As credit-building cards, the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> and Credit One Bank Platinum Visa offer only the basic benefits generally offered with most credit cards. These basic benefits include fraud protection, autopay, mobile access, account notifications, and payment reporting to the major credit bureaus.</p><p>Both cards offer potential credit line increases, giving you access to more credit. With the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span>, you may qualify for an invitation from Petal to its Leap program, which allows you to increase your credit limit through a history of qualifying on-time payments and maintaining a qualifying credit score.</p><p>Credit One Bank offers automatic account reviews for credit line increases based on your overall credit performance. Cardholders have the option to choose their payment date once every six months. The Platinum Visa comes with optional credit protections for an additional fee. The optional benefit provides financial protection if you become involuntarily unemployed or disabled.</p><p>Additional perks winner: Tie</p><h2 id=which-card-earns-the-most>Which Card earns the most?</h2><p>The Credit One Bank Platinum Visa offers higher earning potential, primarily because it's the only one that offers cash back rewards on everyday spending in bonus categories. Considering the spending habits of the average American, a cardholder's monthly budget may include trips to the gas station or grocery store or line items for mobile devices, internet, cable or satellite TV services. The amount of cash back you could earn depends on your spending habits.</p><p>Both cards earn cash back at select retailers. Neither program requires activating offers, so you'll earn rewards automatically with qualifying purchases. Still, these promotional offers change often and may vary based on location. Predicting how much cash back you could earn through promotional offers with either card is impossible.</p><h2 id=our-recommendations>Our recommendations</h2><h3>Why we recommend <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span></h3><p><span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> has no annual fee and comes with a potentially lower APR, depending on your credit score. It's also a great option for people who may not meet the credit requirements for other credit cards. The card issuer allows you to apply for a card without a credit check when you link a bank account(s). Instead, Petal looks at your monthly bills and income when determining eligibility, which could help you qualify despite past credit mistakes or limited credit history.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why you would still opt for Credit One Bank Platinum Visa</h3><p>The Credit One Bank Platinum Visa is still an excellent option to help build credit. While it carries a $39 annual fee, it may be worth paying to access credit and start building your credit profile. Also, the Platinum Visa earns unlimited cash back rewards, allowing you to recoup some of your spending while building credit.</p><h2 id=time-stamp-prequalification-allows-you-to-check-offers>TIME Stamp: Prequalification allows you to check offers</h2><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> and the Credit One Bank Platinum Visa are viable tools for building or rebuilding your credit. Both card issuers report payments to the three major credit bureaus, allowing you to build your credit profile with responsible card use.</p><p>Petal and Credit One offer prequalification, allowing you to check card offers without negatively affecting your credit score. Prequalification does not guarantee approval for the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> or Credit One Bank Platinum Visa or other cards available through the card issuers. Still, it gives you a clearer picture of your standing and whether you meet the basic criteria to qualify for these or other cards.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Does the <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> credit card do a hard inquiry?</h3><p>The <span class="quidget__Container-sc-1i4ka6a-0 fIGkab"><a class=sh-quidget-markup data-rate-name="Petal(R) 1 No Annual Fee Visa(R) Credit Card" data-content={*credit_card_id*:*4048225*,*field*:*LinkTagPDPUrl*,*api*:*cc*,*linkText*:*card_name*,*linkTarget*:*_blank*,*linkRel*:*sponsored*} rel=nofollow href=#>card_name</a></span> does not require a hard inquiry when you apply. You can instead apply using a linked bank account(s). Petal will look at other factors, such as your monthly bills and income, to determine eligibility for a credit card.</p><h3>Does the Petal 1 card have preapproval?</h3><p>Yes, Petal offers preapproval for its credit cards. Pre approval won't impact your credit score but doesn't guarantee approval for a card.</p><h3>How can I check my Credit One Visa Platinum application status?</h3><p>Applicants can check the status of card applications online at Credit One Bank's website.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmapnaKovK%2Bty2adoqaRo7Cme8Crq6KbnJp8sbHTmqNmaV2rtrStjK%2BqZpuimrGqwIyopZ5lkpa7rHnPpZitoZ6qum7CyKyYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./asap-rocky-attends-kanye-wests-sunday-service-1203291739.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>A$AP Rocky Attends Kanye Wests Sunday Service</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./heat-wave-us-july-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Massive Heat Wave Will Sweep Across the U.S. This Week</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

With a prequel hot off a successful first season (<i>1883</i>), two more spinoffs in the pipeline (<i>1932</i> and <i>6666</i>), and a new Jeremy Renner vehicle recently renewed for a second season (<i>Mayor of Kingstown</i>), Sheridan has built a TV empire—and that’s not even mentioning the handful of other series he has under development. Sheridan’s clearly not going anywhere.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But what do you watch when you’ve devoured the entire Taylor Sheridan oeuvre, including his movies—my favorites are his screenplays for <i>Sicario</i> and <i>Hell or High Water</i>—and you’re still in the mood for more? <i>Yellowstone</i> is a series that appeals to viewers for any number of reasons; an average viewer might come for old-school frontier-justice thrills and stay for the beautiful Montana vistas and gorgeously naturalistic ranching scenes. At times it’s a brutally violent crime thriller; in other scenes, it’s a vaguely political drama about land ownership, or an exploration of PTSD and inherited trauma. That’s why it’s easy to find a number of shows that scratch that <i>Yellowstone</i> itch—whether they’re set in the Wild West or the biggest city in the world.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Justified</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Let’s begin with another modern western drama: <a href=#><i>Justified</i></a>, a 2010 FX drama based on Elmore Leonard’s novella <i>Fire in the Hole</i>. Developed by Graham Yost, <i>Justified</i> brings an Old West-style lawman, Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant), into the present day. Givens is reassigned to Lexington, Kentucky, after his quick-draw shooting of a hitman in Miami—an act of just-barely-justifiable vigilante justice that easily recalls <i>Yellowstone</i>’s John Dutton and the branded ranch hands who do his bidding (though they face far fewer consequences than Givens). A new sequel series has been announced entitled <i>Justified: City Primeval</i>, so it’s the perfect time to catch up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Hulu<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Deadwood</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">…But <i>Justified </i>wouldn’t exist without <a href=#><i>Deadwood</i></a>, David Milch’s groundbreaking western drama for HBO, which initially introduced Olyphant to a wider audience. Co-anchored by an instantly classic lead performance from Ian McShane, <i>Deadwood</i> tells the fictionalized origin story of the settlement Deadwood, South Dakota. Focusing primarily on real-life Deadwood residents and featuring countless other historical figures, the series infused its civilization mythmaking with comedy and tragedy, becoming one of the greatest dramas ever despite its famously too-soon cancellation in 2006. Luckily, the series was resurrected for a satisfying final movie 13 years later. And though it remains under-recognized, <i>Deadwood</i> still starts conversations today—like in this spring’s comprehensive <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Deadwood Bible</i></a> by critic Matt Zoller Seitz.<b></b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> HBO Max<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Gunsmoke</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Let’s travel back to the beginning of serious TV westerns. <a href=#><i>Gunsmoke</i></a> began in 1952 as a radio series, before making the jump to TV in 1955. Over the next 20 years, the show would produce 635 episodes, weathering a switch from half-hour to hour-long episodes and, eventually, a transition to color. (That made it the longest-running live-action primetime TV series ever, until <i>Law & Order: SVU</i> surpassed it a few years ago.) Centered on the virtuous but nuanced Marshal Matt Dillon (James Arness), the series is set in Dodge City, Kansas, in the 1870s. It’s filled with fascinating, funny, and moving morality tales, often penned by legends like Sam Peckinpah. It gave a necessary dose of weight and grit to the classic western—and kicked off a slew of new western dramas that lived in its shadow.<b></b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Some available on Pluto TV and Paramount+<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Bonanza</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is another classic western series that inspired countless imitators. <i>Bonanza</i> follows the daily lives of the beloved Cartwright family: patriarch Ben (Lorne Greene) and his sons Adam (Pernell Roberts), Hoss (Dan Blocker), and Little Joe (Michael Landon). Transposing family-focused conflicts from the classic sitcom into a western template, the show tackled serious social issues and modest everyday drama. Setting most of its stories at the Ponderosa Ranch and in nearby towns, <i>Bonanza</i> provided an unusually realistic look at ranch life.<b></b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Some available on YouTube and The Roku Channel</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Dallas</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the melodramatic side of the western family drama is <i>Dallas</i>—while the Cartwrights were mutually supportive and endearing, the Ewings of Texas were constantly scheming and feuding. It’s easy to see why <i>Yellowstone</i> was immediately <a href=# rel=noopener>likened</a> to this soap opera when it first premiered; they share a sensibility, though <i>Yellowstone</i> has never had a character break out to the level that greedy oil tycoon J.R. Ewing did. J.R. made <i>Dallas</i> the highest rated nighttime soap of the ’70s and ’80s—and his specific brand of charismatic evil has influenced TV villains for decades.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> IMDb TV<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Succession</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s a reason many have called <i>Yellowstone</i> “<a href=# rel=noopener><i>Succession</i> in the West</a>.” Setting aside the differences in setting and style, the two dramas have a lot in common: a rich patriarch presiding over an empire, four kids (primarily two younger sons and a daughter) jockeying for control of that empire, and a larger meditation on the ephemerality of power. When it comes to viewership, <a href=#><i>Succession</i></a> has nowhere near the numbers of its western counterpart—but its blend of incisive satire and sneakily moving family drama have earned it widespread acclaim as one of the best series currently on TV.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> HBO Max</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Godless</b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Outside of the <a href=#>Taylor Sheridan</a> universe, <i>Godless</i> is one of TV’s more recent western hits. Set in 1884, the drama focuses on a young outlaw named Roy (Jack O’Connell) who’s on the run after betraying his terrifying criminal father figure Frank (Jeff Daniels) during a robbery. But what really sets this one apart from other westerns is its unusually female ensemble, offering rich roles for actresses like Merritt Wever and Michelle Dockery that far surpass <i>Yellowstone</i>’s two female characters, Beth and Monica. And at only seven episodes, <i>Godless</i> is an easy binge.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Netflix</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>Longmire</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of <i>Yellowstone</i>’s biggest assets is its setting; it luxuriates in the natural beauty of Montana and Utah, where much of the series is filmed. The 2012 western crime drama <i>Longmire</i>, originally on A&E until it was canceled and picked up by Netflix, shares that strength. It focuses on a county sheriff in the Wyoming plains—making it another rare rural series, alongside <i>Yellowstone</i> and the popular Missouri-set drama <i>Ozark</i>. It’s also one that features Native American actors and characters, and like <i>Yellowstone</i>, it spotlights the conflicts that arise between competing authorities over tribal jurisdiction.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> Netflix<b></b></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b>The Sopranos</b><b></b></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What ever happened to Gary Cooper?” Tony Soprano asked in the pilot of <a href=#><i>The Sopranos</i></a>, often regarded as the best TV drama of all time. “The strong, silent type. <i>That</i> was an American. He wasn’t in touch with his feelings. He just did what he had to do.” In 1999, Tony embodied a particular strain of American masculinity: resistant to change, and reverent towards the mythically confident western heroes of Hollywood’s Golden Age. His obsession with the past—and a reliance on violence, powered by delusional rationalization—formed the basis for most modern TV antiheroes, including <i>Yellowstone</i>’s John Dutton, a man even more stubborn about expressing his feelings than Tony. You don’t need me to explain why you should watch <i>The Sopranos</i>; it’s <i>The Sopranos</i>.<b></b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Where to stream:</strong> HBO Max</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWVugHWBjq2tZquYpMS0edaaq5ygXZaztbHRZrCepJykxLTAzqecaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ce-qui-attend-frederic-sanchez-fraichement-nomme-president-du-fnap.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ce qui attend Frdric Sanchez, frachement nomm prsident du Fnap</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1527973-75-deep-love-song-lyrics-express-feelings.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>75+ deep love song lyrics for him to express your feelings</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

Reflecting on his boisterous show exit, he revealed how casting of former press secretary Sean Spicer during season 29 played up a part in his exit.</p><p>“I said, ‘Well look, 2019 is the threshold to an election year in America, we are a very divided country. Just nobody, of any party, don’t go there — just make us the wonderful escape from all that divisiveness for two hours a week’,” he said.</p><p>Believing that his advice was taken seriously, he then received a phone call a few weeks later. At the time, the showrunner and another producer gave him a rundown of the celebrities and public figures set to compete on the show, then finding out that Spicer is among those in the list.</p><p>“I said, ‘Guys, this is exactly what we said we wouldn’t do. Don’t go there. This is not the right time, play to our strengths, be the show that gives people a break from all this bullsh*t’,” he said.</p><p>Standing by his opinion, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bergeron</a> suggested that he “take the season off.” However, the showrunner and producer instead advised him to let him out of the contract. According to Bergeron, it “pissed” him off how strongly they felt for the casting.</p><p>“So at that moment, I knew this is probably my last season, because of that one betrayal,” he said. “Up until that point, there were people of character there.”</p><p>Bergeron acted as the DWTS host from 2005 to 2020, leading the show for a total of 28 seasons. In July 2020, he announced on X (formerly known as Twitter) he had been informed that the show will be continuing without him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-wrote-a-statement-about-the-show-s-choice-wants-to-screw-show-executives-back>He Wrote a Statement About The Show’s Choice, Wants to “Screw” Show Executives Back</h2><p>When he knew about the show’s casting decision, he wasn’t apologetic enough to not retaliate. Thus, he decided to issue a stated in response to Spicer’s casting to “let people know that they f*cking lied to me.”</p><p>“So I wrote the statement that I wrote, that did not name anybody, that did not name a political party,” he continued. “It merely said, ‘I was told certain things when I was asked my opinion, they agreed, and now they’ve thrown a curveball.’ I even went so far as to say it’s their right to do that. They’re the producers of the show, if that’s what they want to do they are entitled to do that. We will have to agree to disagree.”</p><p>Burke asked if the DWTS executives anticipated his statement. Bergeron answered confidently, saying that “they didn’t deserve to know.”</p><p>“They had screwed me. I’m gonna screw them,” he said. “But I wanted the viewers to know this was a step too far to me. This was a step too far on the cusp of an election year. And again — had it been a Democrat, same statement.”</p><p>During his appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bob Saget</a>‘s Here for You podcast in 2021, Bergeron claimed he wasn’t surprised when he was fired from DWTS. Additionally, he said that the “the show that I left was not the show that I loved.”</p><p>“So at the end of the season that turned out to be my last season, I kind of knew,” he said. “I took everything out of my dressing room that I really wanted. … It was kind of obvious that we were kind of butting heads [behind the scenes]. It wasn’t a pleasant [experience].”</p><p>Dancing With The Stars airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on ABC and Disney+.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_SimonCowell_LaurenSilverman_EricCowell_Kevin-WinterGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Simon Cowell’s Son Eric May Appear on The Next Series of ‘Britain’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706ikZpqVp7Smvs6nZJqcnZ7BtHnHnmSfnZypeqOx06uYsp2UYq%2B6ecOwq6xlp522pLSMpZydZaSkeqm10mabnqiRp8G2vsRmnaunnWLBqbGMrJyroZWofA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-shelton-kelsea-ballerini-to-perform-at-peoples-choice-country-awards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Blake Shelton, Kelsea Ballerini to Perform at People's Choice Country Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./borat-2-on-the-rocks-academy-1234818003.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>In a Year Filled With Hardship, Will Comedies Like Borat 2, On the Rocks and More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

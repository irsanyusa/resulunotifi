The good news&nbsp;is, when coping with the crisis, spouses reach a&nbsp;new level in&nbsp;their <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a> and find new ways to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy with each other.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> believes that there’s no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage crisis because it’s a&nbsp;sign that the relationship is&nbsp;evolving. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;not give in&nbsp;and look for ways to&nbsp;overcome the difficulties. Because when we&nbsp;promised to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together “for better or&nbsp;for worse,” we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;prove that those words were not just empty rhetoric.</p><p><h3>The 1st year of&nbsp;marriage: Realization stage</h3><h3></h3></p><p class=adme-img-description>The bodacious singer <a href=# title=Pink data-link=tag>Pink</a> proposed to&nbsp;her boyfriend herself. However, the couple broke up&nbsp;one year later... Then they reunited again! The couple is&nbsp;now raising two children.</p><p>Rita DeMaria, a&nbsp;marriage and family therapist, <a href=#>calls </a>this crisis a&nbsp;<strong>“realization stage.”</strong> It&nbsp;usually happens after 6-12 months of&nbsp;living together. The first charm of&nbsp;being in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> disappears and you start seeing your partner the way he/she really is&nbsp;with all of&nbsp;their weaknesses and sometimes not very pleasant habits (that you gladly ignored before). “It’s the time to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;team,” DeMaria says.</p><p><strong>What should you&nbsp;do?</strong> “If&nbsp;you haven’t discussed serious subjects like finance, children, relatives’ visits, free time, etc. before your marriage, it’s time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;now,” Beverly Hayman, a&nbsp;psychologist, recommends. You need to&nbsp;speak honestly about your values and priorities. There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;probability that they will not entirely coincide with those of&nbsp;your partner, and it’s then you two will need to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;compromise. It’s very important to&nbsp;reach a&nbsp;firm agreement to&nbsp;the most “burning” questions during this period of&nbsp;time.</p><p><h3>3-4 years of&nbsp;marriage: A&nbsp;dangerous “comfort zone”</h3><h3></h3></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/997/02b/7b5a6150e69269ad6000415fc6.jpg><p>The marriage of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a> and Sean Penn lasted only 3&nbsp;years, but these stars say in&nbsp;their interviews that they still love each other. Perhaps they rushed to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;divorce?</p><p>Research conducted with 2,000 British married couples <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>showed</a> that in&nbsp;3&nbsp;and a&nbsp;half years, spouses start taking each other for granted, and stop saying “I&nbsp;love you” to&nbsp;each other. Every couple finds its own “comfort zone.” On&nbsp;one hand, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful feeling of&nbsp;security and relaxation, but on&nbsp;the other rather, unpleasant things become normal in&nbsp;their lives, like keeping the door open when you pee and wearing shabby pajamas. Though&nbsp;82% of&nbsp;participating couples said that they were happy in&nbsp;their marriage, 49% mentioned that they wanted their partner to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more romantic.</p><p><strong>What should you&nbsp;do?</strong> You need to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;certain degree of&nbsp;emotional intensity in&nbsp;your life. Compliment each other more often and praise each other’s achievements. It’s better to&nbsp;avoid saying everything that’s on&nbsp;your mind to&nbsp;your partner; sometimes, it’s best to&nbsp;keep silent. If&nbsp;you see that there’s a&nbsp;problem, begin your conversation softly without accusations. The family psychologist John Gottman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recommends</a> looking within first. Growth in&nbsp;marriage happens when each partner is&nbsp;capable of&nbsp;viewing themselves from the outside and understand how much he/she contributes (or&nbsp;doesn’t contribute) to&nbsp;the relationship.</p><p><h2>5-7 years of&nbsp;marriage: “The seven-year itch”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/070/d05/c044855557b2f9d708319ce1b7.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>David Schwimmer from Friends and his wife Zoe Buckman announced that they wanted to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break from their relationship after 7&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage. Their fans hope that this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;temporary decision.</p><p>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain term in&nbsp;western psychology called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“the seven-year itch.”</a> This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most critical periods in&nbsp;every marriage. By&nbsp;this time, the couple has a&nbsp;fine-tuned life, settled relationship, and the spouses treat each other like they’re on&nbsp;autopilot, which is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big mistake, Beverly Hayman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reminds</a>. Interest towards each other decreases due to&nbsp;routine. It&nbsp;seems that the partners know everything about each other. Sometimes a&nbsp;couple makes a&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;first child (or&nbsp;a&nbsp;second one) in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;save their marriage, but it’s worth remembering that a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate person, and not a&nbsp;rescue device.</p><p><strong>What should you&nbsp;do?</strong> Robert Taibbi, a&nbsp;family therapist, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggests</a> the following:</p><p>1. Keep your <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> open. You should be&nbsp;less formal, like “How was your day?” “OK”, but more sincere and emotional.</p><p>2. Solve your problems immediately as&nbsp;they arise, don’t let them pile&nbsp;up.</p><p>3. Listen to&nbsp;yourself. Assess your state from time to&nbsp;time, refresh the list of&nbsp;your wants and your vision of&nbsp;the future. Share your thoughts with your partner.</p><p>4. Discuss the future of&nbsp;your relationship. Which plans do&nbsp;you have for the next year, or&nbsp;next 5&nbsp;or 10? Again, the key is&nbsp;openness and honesty, not politeness and vagueness.</p><p><h3>10-15 years of&nbsp;marriage: “A&nbsp;difficult age”</h3><h3></h3></p><p class=adme-img-description><a href=# title="Megan Fox" data-link=tag>Megan Fox</a> and Brian Austin Green almost got divorced when their relationship reached 11&nbsp;years together. Still they managed to&nbsp;save their marriage and now the couple has 3&nbsp;children.</p><p>In&nbsp;accordance with a&nbsp;recent <a href=#>study</a>, 10&nbsp;years is&nbsp;the most difficult threshold of&nbsp;any relationship.&nbsp;2,000 married women from the USA who were interviewed said that the 11th year of&nbsp;marriage is&nbsp;the most difficult. Women experience a&nbsp;huge load of&nbsp;responsibilities during this period of&nbsp;time: they have to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;their tween children, of&nbsp;their home, and they also have to&nbsp;work. Since they always lack time, the quality of&nbsp;their relationship decreases. A&nbsp;husband can stop seeing his wife as&nbsp;an&nbsp;attractive woman. <a href=#>Statistical data</a> claims that an&nbsp;average marriage in&nbsp;Europe lasts for approximately 11&nbsp;years.</p><p><strong>What should you&nbsp;do?</strong> The good news is&nbsp;that if&nbsp;you overcome this time period, the satisfaction with your relationship will continuously increase during the following 20&nbsp;years. Family therapists Dana Fillmore and Amy Barnhart recommend that you treat your relationships with humor—including yourself. Laugh together more often and lower the level of&nbsp;your expectations. Maybe your marriage isn’t perfect, but is&nbsp;it&nbsp;really that bad? Focus your attention on&nbsp;the positive side of&nbsp;your marriage and your partner.</p><p><h2>20-30 years of&nbsp;marriage: Midlife crisis and “gray divorce”</h2><h2></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e60/372/9daa3351b4b593530edb710282.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman broke up&nbsp;after 30&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage which shocked their fans. However, a&nbsp;year later they understood that they had made a&nbsp;mistake and reunited.</p><p>The crisis of&nbsp;20&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage happens due to&nbsp;the personal midlife crises of&nbsp;both spouses. The effect is&nbsp;increased by&nbsp;a&nbsp;so&nbsp;called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>empty-nest syndrome</a> when children grow up&nbsp;and leave the family home while the spouses stay by&nbsp;themselves, like in&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;their relationship. The spouses may feel that their marriage is&nbsp;exhausted because its main mission is&nbsp;completed. American psychologists call this divorce <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>“gray divorce”</a> because some spouses have already become gray-haired by&nbsp;this time. In&nbsp;recent times, the number of&nbsp;these divorces has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>growing</a>.</p><p><strong>What should you&nbsp;do?</strong> Don’t distance from each other. Look for other meanings of&nbsp;existence for you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. If&nbsp;spouses ignored their marriage problems while raising children then, when it’s just the two of&nbsp;them, the conflicts may become more intense. On&nbsp;the other hand, you have more time to&nbsp;solve them. It’s a&nbsp;great opportunity to&nbsp;rebuild your marriage. Steve Seabold, a&nbsp;relationship coach, recommends doing sports together and creating new common goals, like travel, new business, language courses, or&nbsp;something that will help you to&nbsp;create unforgettable experiences.</p><p><h3>Non-standard recommendations to&nbsp;overcome a&nbsp;marriage crisis</h3><h3></h3></p><p>Mort Fertel, a&nbsp;relationship expert, <a href=#>thinks</a> that popular recommendations to&nbsp;marriage rescue like sharing feelings with a&nbsp;partner or&nbsp;visiting a&nbsp;family psychologist are not always effective because they don’t define what exactly needs <strong>to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done</strong> to&nbsp;overcome the crisis.</p><p>Here are some unusual recommendations by&nbsp;Mort Fertel on&nbsp;how to&nbsp;save your marriage:</p><p><strong>1. Save your marriage even by&nbsp;yourself.</strong> It’s usually believed that a&nbsp;marriage can be&nbsp;saved only when both partners are ready to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;problems. “The efforts made by&nbsp;even one person can change the marriage dynamics and can motivate the more stubborn spouse to&nbsp;join the process of&nbsp;the marriage rescue,” Mort Fertel says.</p><p><b>2. Don’t ask yourself wrong questions. </b>Don’t ask yourself, “Is&nbsp;this the right person I’ve chosen for a&nbsp;spouse?” The key to&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful marriage is&nbsp;not to&nbsp;find the right person but to&nbsp;learn to&nbsp;love the one that you found. Because love is&nbsp;not luck, it’s your choice.</p><p><b>3. Separation drives you apart, not closer. </b>Separation, which allegedly can refresh your feelings, can distance you from each other even more, especially during a&nbsp;marriage crisis where your goal is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer again.</p><p><b>4. Talk less about problems. </b>Conversations about marriage problems don’t solve them but make them deeper. They cause arguments and anger. Talking about a&nbsp;problem doesn’t mean you solved&nbsp;it. Talk less, do&nbsp;more. Find real ways to&nbsp;solve your difficulties.</p><p><b>5. Don’t think that a&nbsp;therapist will give you the exact answers. </b>Therapy sessions help spouses talk to&nbsp;each other and understand each other’s point of&nbsp;view, but they don’t give answers regarding what needs <strong>to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done</strong> to&nbsp;save the marriage. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, couples remain very disappointed with their therapy.</p><p><strong>6. Don’t tell your relatives and friends about your marriage crisis. </strong>“One of&nbsp;the most important values of&nbsp;marriage is&nbsp;confidentiality, that’s why talking to&nbsp;your relatives or&nbsp;friends about your marriage or&nbsp;your spouse is&nbsp;a&nbsp;big mistake. This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;violation of&nbsp;confidentiality for your spouse, and it’s wrong,” Mort Fertel says.</p><p><h3>Bonus</h3><h3></h3></p><p>In&nbsp;2017, one of&nbsp;the most stable Hollywood couples&nbsp;— Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne&nbsp;— celebrated their 35th anniversary.

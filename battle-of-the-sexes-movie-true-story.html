King was at the top of her game, the first female player to win over $100,000 in a year. Riggs was an over-the-hill showboat and self-declared chauvinist pig with a gambling problem. Riggs hoped for one last minute of fame, King to prove that women deserved as much prize money and respect as men.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ninety million people tuned into “The Battle of the Sexes,” and 44 years later Emma Stone and Steve Carrell are bringing the match to the big screen. The movie details both the on-court drama and the behind-the-scenes turmoil affecting the two tennis legends. The married King had recently begun an affair with a woman, while Riggs was struggling to connect with his family. Here’s what the movie got right about the historic game that made King an icon — and what the filmmakers exaggerated.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Billie Jean King came into conflict with Jack Kramer</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once a tennis champ himself, Kramer (Bill Pullman) was running the Pacific Southwest Tennis Tournament in 1970. That tournament offered women just 15% of the prize money that it awarded the men, despite that the women’s final sold as many tickets as the men’s final did. King challenged Kramer about the pay gap, and when he would not agree to up the women’s prize money, King led a walk-out. She and several other women went on to create the Virginia Slims tour and later the Women’s Tennis Association.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kramer and King came into conflict again three years later on the eve of the Battle of the Sexes game. Kramer was set to be a commentator for the game, and King threatened to call off the match at the last minute if Kramer wasn’t removed. She argued that he was biased against female tennis players. The network conceded to her demands.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Virginia Slims sponsored that women’s tennis tour</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In retrospect, the cigarette company was probably not the best sponsor of an athletic tournament. But it was the only advertising money they could get. Sarah Silverman’s character, Gladys Heldman, did indeed arrange the Virginia Slims tour. She asked the players to sign symbolic $1 contracts before they had enough money to pay the players and then wrangled sponsors. The women were suspended by the USTA but when the women’s tour proved successful, the two tours merged again.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Once a tennis player herself, Heldman founded World Tennis magazine and supported female tennis players in their support for equal pay. Her own daughter, Julie, even joined the separate women’s tour.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Riggs <a href=# rel=noopener>played poker</a> with his therapist</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He was, truly, a hustler.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fiction: King and Riggs were old friends</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the movie, the two tennis players seem to know each other well — not only does Riggs call King in the middle of the night to challenge her to a match, but King dismisses the call as typical Riggs behavior. In reality, King <a href=# rel=noopener>says</a> she barely knew the former champion, who was 25 years her senior.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, after the Battle of the Sexes the two became friends and remained close until his death in 1995. King said she spoke to Riggs the day before he died, and they said “I love you” to each other.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: King did initially turn Riggs down for the match</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And he did then ask Margaret Court (Jessica McNamee) to play him instead. Riggs defeated Court in the “Mother’s Day Massacre,” which changed King’s mind about playing Riggs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">King and Court really were rivals, their careers intertwined. King’s first major singles success came in 1972 when she upset the top-seeded Court in the second round of Wimbledon. For the next decade, they competed for the top spot of the women’s rankings. Over the course of their careers, Court won 24 majors, and King just 12. That made King’s ability to defeat Riggs after the Mother’s Day Massacre extra sweet.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Margaret Court is opposed to same-sex marriage</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The conservative tennis player has <a href=# rel=noopener>publicly called</a> same-sex relationships “a lust for the flesh.”</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Fact: During the “Battle of the Sexes,” Billie Jean King was involved with her hairdresser</strong></h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The affair really did take place in the period before the Battle of the Sexes. King’s relationship with hairdresser Marilyn Barnett later became public in 1981 when Barnett sued King for a share of the tennis player’s property. In the suit, Barnett argued that because she gave up her career as a hairdresser to become a secretary, confidante, cook “and all other things necessary so that Mrs. King’s energy could be totally directed toward playing tennis,” under California law Barnett was due palimony, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to</a> the New York Times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">King, who was still married to Larry King (Austin Stowell in the movie) at the time, initially denied the affair. But later that year she called a press conference in which she admitted her involvement with Barnett (Andrew Riseborough). “People’s privacy is very important, but unfortunately someone didn’t respect that,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> The Chicago Tribune. “I did have an affair with Marilyn, but it was over quite some time ago. I’m very disturbed and shocked that Marilyn would do this in such a selfish way.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Billie Jean and Larry King divorced in 1987. King is now in a relationship with Ilana Kloss, also a former tennis player. She has since become a prominent booster for LGBTQ rights.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fiction: Barnett showed up right before King’s match to give her a haircut</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The scene in which Barnett runs out of her salon to find King and give her a confidence boost (and a haircut) right before her face-off with Riggs is Hollywood fabrication. The haircut did happen but in Los Angeles before King left for the match in Houston.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Riggs was sponsored by Sugar Daddy</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gettyimages-515119972.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Designer Ted Tinling did indeed design King’s dress for Battle of the Sexes</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alan Cumming’s character really did dress the female tennis players for the Virginia Slims Tennis Circuit. A former World War II spy and tennis player himself, Tinling became infamous in the tennis world when he was banned from Wimbledon because his outfits were “too racy,” <a href=# rel=noopener>according to</a> Cumming.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Howard Cosell draped an arm around tennis star Rosie Casals during the match commentary</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The condescending move was all-too-real and broadcast on live TV. The filmmakers edited actor Natalie Morales into the real footage.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: King wore blue suede shoes</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her outfit is now on display at the Smithsonian.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Riggs was taking 415 vitamins a day before the match</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before the match with Margaret Court, the 55-year-old Riggs enlisted the help of Hollywood nutrition guru Rheo Blair. He began a protein and dairy-focused diet and popped hundreds of vitamins every day.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: Larry Riggs did not attend the match</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Selena Roberts <a href=# rel=noopener>writes</a> in A Necessary Spectacle that Bobby Riggs’ son foresaw his father’s downfall when Bobby didn’t take his training seriously. In protest, he refused to attend the King-Riggs match.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Fact: Billie Jean King was carried like Cleopatra into the Astrodome</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gettyimages-515109456.jpg><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fact: When King won, Riggs said, “I really underestimated you.”</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">King has shared the mid-court conversation, included in the movie, with reporters. Riggs reportedly later <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> after the match, “This is the worst thing in the world I’ve ever done.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">ESPN <a href=# rel=noopener>once reported</a> that the entire match was rigged by the mob. King denies that this was true, and the directors <a href=# rel=noopener>say</a> that those they spoke to close to Bobby thought the accusation “ridiculous.” The filmmakers probably show Riggs betting on himself to win in the film in order to debunk the rigging rumor.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Fiction: King cried alone in the locker room after winning</h3><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">King says didn’t get a moment to herself after the historic match. “They kept me so busy after that, but that’s how I was feeling, such relief,” King <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> USA Today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWVnfXGAjpuYraycmnqwsoytn55lo5rFpr%2BMpqavoZViwbPBxGaqraeirnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./boston-consulting-group-et-cm-international-choisis-pour-levaluation-des-poles-de-competitivite.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Boston Consulting Group et CM International choisis pour l'valuation des ples de comptitivit</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./american-horror-story-season-8-murder-house-coven-1202846850.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>American Horror Story Season 8 Will Be Murder House-Coven Crossover, Ryan Mu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./american-idols-lauren-alaina-marries-cam-arnold-in-nashville-wedding.html>'American Idol's Lauren Alaina Marries Cam Arnold in Nashville Wedding</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paid-family-leave-kyte-baby-brands.html>A Lesson in Brand Crisis and Paid Parental Leave</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./maximize-tax-savings-tax-deductible-donations.html>How to Maximize Tax Savings From Tax-Deductible Donations</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./linsertion-par-lactivite-economique-menagee-mais-menacee.html>L'insertion par l'activit conomique mnage, mais menace</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./la-cnil-consulte-sur-lusage-des-cameras-intelligentes.html>La Cnil consulte sur lusage des camras intelligentes</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxVlog.

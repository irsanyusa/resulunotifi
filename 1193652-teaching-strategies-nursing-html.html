So far, lecture has proven to be a cost- and time-efficient way to present lots of information to many students at once. While most people associate lectures with a boring waste of time, it does not have to be that way. You can utilise video presentations and slide shows to make the topic more interesting and maybe show some examples of what you are talking about.</li><li><strong>High Fidelity Simulation. </strong>What is important for future nurses is practice, which is why you should incorporate some realistic clinical scenarios into your lessons to help your students learn about the importance of teamwork and develop critical thinking. With the help of the high fidelity simulation, they will be able to learn in a safe and controlled environment, where they can make and correct mistakes in real time under supervision.</li><li><strong>Concept Mapping.</strong> With this strategy, learners can figure out the connection between different concepts. They can acknowledge their understandings at that moment and form some new ideas. This method helps them organise their knowledge in a more logical way and figure out the possible gaps than need filling. Moreover, visual leaning is beneficial for promoting evaluation, analysis and critical thinking.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4f754021c47dad1f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Easy guide on how to write a term paper effectively: Tricks and tips</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7t97gqmm9pb.jpg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Federal universities offering nursing in Nigeria</p><ul><li><strong>Online Courses. </strong>Learning does not end when one steps out of the classroom. In order to get the best nursing education, your students should also use the ‘wonders of technology’ to stay in touch with the recent trends in nursing, as well as find some online courses to improve their qualification. Make sure you are able to recommend some good resources if your students ask for your recommendation.</li><li><strong>Games. </strong>It is important not to forget that most nursing students are still children at heart who might find it hard to focus on dull lectures. When you feel like your class’ attention starts to slip away, introduce some games in order to increase interest and motivation of your students.</li><li><strong>Role-playing. </strong>While simulation is important to train the young minds for what they might encounter in the future, you cannot work through every possible scenario. That is where imagination should kick in. With role-playing, students will be able to see how things are supposed to work on both sides, as well as work on their communication skills and conflict management.</li><li><strong>Jigsaw Classroom. </strong>This technique is frequently used for younger learners, but it also works great with older students. If you are not familiar with the concept of a jigsaw classroom, it is when the class is divided into several groups, and each group member has their own assignment that they need to present for their group. This way, each student will have a deeper understanding of their topic and learn about other topics by listening to their classmates.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3niht84rtdkg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Check out these 50 excellent debate topics for students</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4f754021c47dad1f.png><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Cheapest nursing schools in Canada for international students</p><ul><li><strong>Case Study. </strong>This strategy is useful for many fields, and nursing in particular. As nurses often deal with similar cases on the daily, it is a good idea to pick a typical (or even atypical) case and offer students to find solutions to the problem it revolves around. Working on case studies can help learners put the theory they have learned to practice and improve their critical thinking skills. After they try to find a solution themselves, you should offer your own. That way, they will know if they are moving in the right direction.</li><li><strong>Debates. </strong>After a long day of studying, you can always offer your students to participate in debates. Not only will they be able to work on their presentation skills and quick thinking, but they will also have an opportunity to talk things through and hear opinions that may differ from theirs. After the debate is over, it would also be helpful for them to receive feedback from a higher authority (meaning you).</li><li><strong>Problem-Based Learning. </strong>With this strategy, you can actually take a step back and relax a little, as your students will do most of the work themselves. While they engage in hands-on training in tackling real-life problems, all you have to do is observe and provide feedback. Students will be able to learn how to work in teams, solve problems with the help of critical thinking and learn independently.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4d9ac9832f84569f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Financial literacy: definition, importance, and improval tips you can start using today!</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These are the strategies you can consider when working with your nursing students.

When they question him, he says he was a "pawn." He also says that Archie was marked for death.

Hiram denies the claim.</p><p>In the abandoned mines by Shadow Lake, there are drawings of the Gargoyle King and his associated symbols on the wall, he attacks Betty and Alice at the Cooper home, and when Betty is thrown into the Sisters of Quiet Mercy, everyone is painting various versions of the king.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Betty learns that the "Gargoyle King" has a "chamber" at the group home and is taken to see him after she is caught looking at her health file.</p><p>While on Fizzle Rocks, Betty sees the Gargoyle King in Sister Woodhouses's office.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-33>So who or what is it?</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-e8713d8e-49b2-4c37-b81a-f7a0799a3a25 data-caption="gargoyle king riverdale"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/iXgktktTURBXy9kNTcwZDI1Yy05MDg2LTRlMmItYmNiZS03ZmNiMjlhMzBhYzAucG5nkZUCzQMWzQJRwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Showrunner and creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa <a href=# id=8180070a-aa0b-346a-aa25-e0a3e084520c>described the Gargoyle King</a> as "gruesome, gory, grim, and gnarly" on Twitter, but viewers have no idea what it actually is.</p><p>Betty and Jughead get the first glimpse of the creature when they go into the woods looking for Ethel and the bunker. What they find instead is a tall creature with a head that looks like a horse's skull covered in blood with wings made of sticks. Fans get a better look at the creature when it visits Ethel in the hospital.</p><p>It's later revealed that Alice once saw the creature in the high school when she played G&G her junior year of high school.</p><p>Is it a man (or woman) dressed in a creepy costume? Is a mystical creature? (Riverdale is only a town over from <a href=# id=cfa2fee7-0bc2-3fa3-aa35-e9fdeb835183>Greendale, Sabrina Spellman, and witches</a> .)
